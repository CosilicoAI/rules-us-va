History History. 1975, cc. 14, 15. Annotations Editors note. At its special session of 1971 the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to make a thorough study of the criminal laws of the State and make recommendatio ns for the review and recodification of all statutes of the State relating to crime and criminal procedure. In November of 1973 the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing a proposed revision of Title 18.1, which was pu blished as House Document 10 of the 1974 Session. This report contains revisors notes and other explanatory matter, which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion here. The proposed revision of Title 18.1 was not adopted by the 1974 General Ass embly, but was carried over to the 1975 Session, when it was adopted, with modifications, as Chapters 14 and 15 of the Acts of 1975, the two acts being substantially identical. Effective Oct. 1, 1975, the 1975 acts repeal Title 18.1 of the Code and enact in lieu thereof a new Title 18.2. In addition to its revision by Chapters 14 and 15, former Title 18.1 was also amended by certain other acts passed at the 1975 Session. As required by § 30-152, the Code Commission has incorporated the majority of th ese amendments into new Title 18.2. Many of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 18.1 or prior law. Law Review.

Rape &amp; Other S exual Offenses, § 3. CASE NOTES The same act cannot at the same time constitute a felony and a misdemeanor. They cannot coexist as the result of one and the same transaction. The crime must be one or the other, not both, or either. Benton v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 570, 16 S.E. 725, 1893 Va. LEXIS 76 (1893). And the grade of the offense is fixed by the punishment provided by statute. Bell v. Com monwealth, 167 Va. 526, 189 S.E. 441, 1937 Va. LEXIS 293 (1937). For the legislature never intended to leave the grade of any offense to the discretion of a jury. Benton v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 570, 16 S.E. 725, 1893 Va. LEXIS 76 (1893). A felony is such an offense as may be (not must be) punished by death or confinement in the penitentiary (now state correctional facility). Canada v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 899, 1872 Va. LEXIS 68 (1872); Benton v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 570, 16 S.E. 725, 1893 Va. LEXIS 76 (1893); Forbes v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 550, 19 S.E. 164, 1894 Va. LEXIS 21 (1894); Benton v. Commonwealth, 91 Va. 782, 21 S.E. 495, 1895 Va. LEXIS 75 (1895); Fletcher v. Commonwealth, 163 Va. 1007, 175 S.E. 895, 1934 Va. LEXIS 220 (1934). Notwithstanding lesser jury verdict.  Where the punishment prescribed may be death or confinement in the penitentiary (now state correctional facility), it is a felony notwithstanding that the jury ac tually imposes a less penalty, by virtue of a discretion allowed them. Quillin v. Commonwealth, 105 Va. 874, 54 S.E. 333, 1906 Va. LEXIS 95 (1906) (see Fletcher v. Commonwealth, 163 Va. 1007, 175 S.E. 895 (1934)). Whatever is not a felony is a misdemeanor. Commonwealth v. Callaghan, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 460 (1825). All offenses which cannot be punished with death or confinement in the penitentiary (now state correctional facility) are misdemeanors. Trimble v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 143 (1818); Benton v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 570, 16 S.E. 725, 1893 Va. LEXIS 76 (1893); Forbes v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 550, 19 S.E. 164, 1894 Va. LEXIS 21 (1894); Benton v. Commonwealth, 91 Va. 782, 21 S.E. 495, 1895 Va. LEXIS 75 (1895). There is no distinction between capital cases and felonies as exists in some other jurisdictions or as existed at common law. This section classifies offenses as either felonies or misdemeanors. Such offenses as are punishable with death or confinement in the penitentiary (now state correctional facility) are felonies; all o ther offenses are misdemeanors. Roach v. Commonwealth, 157 Va. 954, 162 S.E. 50, 1932 Va. LEXIS 335 (1932). The committing magistrate does not by his warrant fix the grade of the offense for which the accused is tried. Hawley v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. 847, 1880 Va. LEXIS 15 (1880). In c ase of doubt, court will construe crime as misdemeanor.  This section defines felonies to be such offenses as are punishable with death or confinement in the penitentiary (now state correctional facility), all other offenses are misdemeanors. There is nothing in the statute which prohibits imprisonment in jail for a longer period than one year. Where a crime may be construed either a misdemeanor or a felony, the court will construe it a misdemeanor, thus applyi ng the well-recognized principle that a penal statute must be construed strictly in favor of the accused. Young v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1152, 156 S.E. 565, 1931 Va. LEXIS 292 (1931). Forgery.  This section makes clear that whether forgery is a felony or is a misdemeanor is determined by the sentence lawfully possible under former § 18.1-96 (now § 18.2-172) and does not depend upon the sentence actually imposed or the nature of the offense. United States v. Johnson, 497 F.2d 548, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 8924 (4th Cir. 1974). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Discretion of Commonwealths At torney.  Because the Commonwealths Attorney, who had the discretion to prosecute misdemeanors, stated that he would not prosecute any presentment that could be returne d for traffic infractions involving placing locks on a bridge, the circuit court would not interfere with that discretion. In re Public Nuisance Complaint of Gregory, 98 Va. Cir. 104, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 9 (Norfolk Jan. 30, 2018). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Trial court may not order a person convicted of felony to ser ve any confinement in jail on weekends or nonconsecutive days.  The plain language of § 53.1-131.1, limits the courts authority to convictions for misdemeanors, traffic offenses and violations of Chapter 5 (§ 20-61 e t seq.) Title 20. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Harvey L. Bryant, Commonwealths Attorney, City of Virginia Beach, 12-062, 2012 Va.

CASE NOTES Punishment for violation of an ordinance may not exceed penalties pres cribed by general law for like offenses.  Virginia Beach ordinance, which punished destruction of property by fine of up to $2,500 and up to 12 months in jail, manifested a conflict with state law because the penalty that attached exceeded the penalty under the state code destruction of property statute, § 18.2-137, a violation of which was punishable only by a fine not exceeding $500. Strout v. City of Va. Beach, 43 Va. App. 99, 596 S.E.2d 529, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 240 (2004). Excessive sentence for Class 2 misdemeanor.  A trial courts sentence of a term of incarceration of 12 months, suspended upon certain terms and conditions, for a Class 2 misdemeanor clearly exceeded the t ime limitation set forth in subdivision (b). Olgers v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 342 (Va. Ct. App. May 9, 2000). Trial court erred in imposing sentence of 30 days in jail, where appellant was convicted for obstruction of justice in violation of § 18.2-460 A, a Class 4 misdemeanor. The punishment for a Class 4 misdemeanor is a fine of not more than $250. Nesbit v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 391, 424 S.E.2d 239, 9 Va. Law Rep. 605, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 288 (1992). One-year versus 12-month sentence.  One-year sentences assessed by the jury for the misdemeanors committed by defendant were beyond the permissible sentencing limit of 12 months. Although the jury h ad been discharged and released before the sentencing improprieties were examined and fixed, the trial court revised the improper verdicts itself after the jury was released, which was impermissible resulting in defendant being entitled to resent encing.

Mandatory minimum punishment; definition. Text Mandatory minimum wherever it appears in this Code means, for purposes of imposing pun ishment upon a person convicted of a crime, that the court shall impose the entire term of confinement, the full amount of the fine and the complete requirement of community service prescribed by law.

CASE NOTES Use of weapon in commission of crime.  Read in conjunction with this section, § 18.2-53.1 expressly requires the court to impose the entire term of confinement and provides that the court shall not suspend the sentence in full or in part. Thus, a trial court may not set the mandatory minimum sentences imposed for multiple convictions under § 18.2-53.1 to run concurrently with each other. Bullock v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 359, 631 S.E.2d 334, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 296 (2006), overruled in part, Brown v. Commonwealth, 284 Va. 538, 733 S.E.2d 638, 2012 Va. LEXIS 190 (2012). Neither § 18.2-12.1 nor § 18.2-53.1, the use or display of a firearm while commiting a felony, prohibit a trial court from running multiple sentences impose d for convictions of § 18.2-53.1 concurrently with each other. To the extent that the holding in Bullock v. Commonwealth, 631 S.E.2d 334 (2006), is inconsistent, it is overruled. Brown v. Commonwealth, 284 Va. 538, 733 S.E.2d 638, 2012 Va. LEXIS 190 (2012). Concurrent sentences proper.  Subdivision C1 of § 18.2-374.1 does not prohibit mandatory minimum sentences imposed under that section from running concurrently as: (1) § 18.2-12.1, defin ing mandatory minimum, does not require that mandatory minimum sentences run consecutively; (2) § 19.2-308 provides that when any person is convicted of two or more offenses, and sentenced to confinement, such sentences shall not run concurrently, unl ess expressly ordered by the court; and (3) if subdivision C1 of § 18.2-374.1 were interpreted to require the mandatory minimum sentences to run consecutively, it would render superfluous the words the Virginia general assembly used in at least 11 oth er criminal statutes explicitly requiring that mandatory minimum sentences run consecutively. Commonwealth v. Jefferson, 60 Va. App. 749, 732 S.E.2d 728, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 323 (2012). Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering defendants six § 18.2-374.1 sentences to run concurrently with each other as: (1) § 18.2-12.1, defi ning mandatory minimum, did not require that mandatory minimum sentences run consecutively; (2) § 19.2-308 provided that when any person was convicted of two or more offenses, and sentenced to confinement, such sentences were not to run concurrently, unless expressly ordered by the court; and (3) if subdivision C1 of § 18.2-374.1 were interpreted to require the mandatory minimum sentences to run consecutively, it would render superfluous the words the Virginia general assembly used in at least 11 other criminal statutes explicitly requiring that mandatory minimum sentences run consecutively.

Criminal responsib ility.  Unless it is otherwise stated, if a statute makes an act criminal, it imposes on all persons who are present purposely giving aid and comfort to the actual wrongd oer criminal responsibility equal to that of the wrongdoer. Spradlin v. Commonwealth, 195 Va. 523, 79 S.E.2d 443, 1954 Va. LEXIS 130 (1954). If there is concert of action with the resulting crime one of its incidental probable consequences, then whether such crime was originally contemplated or not, al l who participate in any way in bringing it about are equally answerable and bound by the acts of every other person connected with the consummation of such resulting crime. The question of whether the offense is the natural and probable result of the in tended wrongful act is usually for the jury. Spradlin v. Commonwealth, 195 Va. 523, 79 S.E.2d 443, 1954 Va. LEXIS 130 (1954). A principal in the second degree is liable for the same punishment as the person who commits the crime. Blankenship v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 293 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 25, 2000). This section makes no exception for those who plan a crime, do not involve themselves with the details of its execution, and are not present for its consummation; this section and the cases direct that an accessory before the fact is accountable in all respects as the principal who carries out the intended crime, as well as any of its natural, probable, and incidental crimes. Charlton v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 47, 526 S.E.2d 289, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 199 (2000). The court treats concert of action as a species of accomplice liability, carrying with i t the principle that the punishment imposed on each accomplice may be the same. Davis v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. App. 291, 549 S.E.2d 631, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 445 (2001). If there is concert of action with the resulting crime one of its incidental probable consequences, then whether such crime was originally contemplated or not, all who participate in any way in bringing it about are equally answerable and bound by the acts of every other person connected with the consummation of such resulting crime. Davi s v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. App. 291, 549 S.E.2d 631, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 445 (2001). Concert of action instruction required.  In a second degree murder prosecution, the trial court was required to give a concert of action instruction where co-defendants were part of a group of people who kicked and stomped the victim while he was on the ground. Davis v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. App. 291, 549 S.E.2d 631, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 445 (2001). Accomplice may be punished despite silence of statute creating an offense.  Where the statute creating an offense fails to provide for the guilt of an accomplice, the omission is not generally considered to indicate an intent to exclude s uch parties from criminal responsibility. Adkins v. Commonwealth, 175 Va. 590, 9 S.E.2d 349, 1940 Va. LEXIS 204 (1940). Lack of intent no de fense.  Each co-actor is responsible for the acts of the others and may not interpose his personal lack of intent as a defense. Charlton v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 47, 526 S.E.2d 289, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 199 (2000). Commonwealth not required to elect between theories.  Because an accessory before the fact and a principal in the second degree may be tried in all respects as a principal in the first degree, the Commonwealth is not required to elect between those two theories, and depending on the evidence, a defendant can be convicted under either theory. Buchanan v. Commonwealth, No. 0960-88-3 (Ct. of Appeals May 8, 1990). II.Who Are Principals and Accessories. A.Principal in First Degree. Principals in the first degree are those who are actors, actual perpetrators of the crime; those who are the immediate perpetrators of the act. Horton v. Commonwealth, 99 Va. 848, 38 S.E. 184, 1901 Va. LEXIS 109 (1901). A principal in the first degree is the actual perpetrator of the crime. Jones v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 370, 157 S.E.2d 907, 1967 Va. LEXIS 227 (1967). One who effects a criminal act through an innocent or unwitting agent is a principal in the first degree, even if the person accused was not present at the time and place of the offense. Bailey v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 258, 329 S.E.2d 37, 1985 Va. LEXIS 201 (1985). Defendant held principal in first degree despite absence of proof defendant was actual perpetrator.  Evidence was held sufficient to prove defendant, on trial for charges of attempted capital murder by arson, was a principal in the first degree, despite absence o f proof that defendant was the perpetrator who lit the fire, rather than his accomplice. Hancock v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 774, 407 S.E.2d 301, 8 Va. Law Rep. 52, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 172 (1991). Instigation of lar ceny.  Where accused was the instigator and moving spirit in bringing about the larceny, procured his associates to commit the crime, and with intent to steal the proper ty, before the event instigated and directed the acts done by his associates in the commission of the crime, and also assisted them in taking and carrying away the goods, he is guilty of actual larceny and subject to punishment as a principal in the firs t degree....</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-19"><akn:num>§ 18.2-19</akn:num><akn:heading>How accessories after the fact punished; certain exceptions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Every accessory after the fact is guilty of (i) a Class 6 felony in the case of a homicide offense that is punishable as a Class 1 or Class 2 felony or (ii) a Class 1 m isdemeanor in the case of any other felony.

Acts 2020, c. 900, cl. 3 provides: That the provisions of this act may result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment or commitment. Pursuant to § 30- 19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined for periods of imprisonment in state adult correctional facilities; therefore, Chapter 854 of the Acts of Assembly of 2019 requires the Virginia Crim inal Sentencing Commission to assign a minimum fiscal impact of $50,000.

Law Review. For note, The Attorney-Client Privilege, see 19 U. Rich. L. Rev. 559 (1985). Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 1A M.J. Accomplices and Accessories, § 2; 9B M.J. Husband and Wife, § 87. CASE NOTES Common-law definition.  This charge constitutes what the law denominates an accessory after the fact. The common law definitely and distinctly defines who is such an offender. He is a pe rson who, knowing a felony to have been committed by another, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the felon. Wren v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 952, 1875 Va. LEXIS 68 (1875). To constitute one an accessory after the fact, three things are requisite: (1) the felon y must be completed; (2) he must know that the felon is guilty; and (3) he must receive, relieve, comfort or assist him. It is necessary that the accessory have notice, direct or implied, at the time he assists or comforts the felon, that he has committe d a felony. Wren v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 952, 1875 Va. LEXIS 68 (1875). Accused not accessory after the fact to murder before victims death.  Accused cannot, as a matter of law, be convicted as an accessory after the fact to a murder because of aid given after the murderers acts but before the victi ms death; however, under such circumstances, the accused may be found to be an accessory after the fact to malicious wounding which, in the Commonwealth, statutorily carries a lesser penalty. Suter v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 311, 796 S.E.2d 416, 20 17 Va. App. LEXIS 42 (2017). Kind of help unimportant.  The true test whether one is accessory after the fact, is to consider whether what he did was done by way of personal help to his principal, with the view of enab ling his principal to elude punishment, the kind of help rendered appearing to be unimportant. Wren v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 952, 1875 Va. LEXIS 68 (1875) (see Buck v. Commonwealth, 116 Va. 1031, 83 S.E. 390 (1914)). Detect ive who allows prisoner to escape not an accessory.  A detective who allows a prisoner to go away without being arrested, and who knows that such criminal has committed a felony, is not an accessory after the fact. Wren v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 952, 1875 Va. LEXIS 68 (1875). Whether accessory after the fact had knowledge of commission of felony is a jury question. Wren v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 952, 1875 Va. LEXIS 68 (1875). Particular evidence necessary to show notice of felony to accessory.  And although it seemed at one time to be doubted whether an implied notice of the felony would not in some cases suffice, as where a man received a felon in the s ame county in which he has been attainted, which was supposed to have been a matter of notoriety, it seems to be the better opinion that some more particular evidence is requisite to raise the presumption of knowledge. Wren v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. (26 Gr att.) 952, 1875 Va. LEXIS 68 (1875). Evidence sufficient.  Evidence, including 911 tape recording giving a narrative report of a larceny in progress, and that defendant was seen with another individual pushing a large bin containing stole machinery to sell at for scrap, was sufficient to convict defendant of grand larceny in violation of § 18.2-19. However, conviction was reversed because 911 recording was improperly admitted. Wilder v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. App. 579, 687 S.E.2d 542, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 24 (2010). Evidence insufficient.  Trial court erred in holding that the evidence was sufficient to find defendant guilty of accessory after the fact to a homicide as defendant was not aware that t he shooter had committed a homicide offense that was punishable by death or a Class 2 felony because, although defendant observed the altercation between the shooter and the victim, saw the shooter produce the gun, saw the shooter fire the gun at the vic tim, immediately thereafter drove the shooter away from the scene, and knew that the shooter had committed a crime at the time she provided assistance to him by driving him away from the scene, a homicide had not yet occurred as the victim did not die un til two days later. Suter v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 311, 796 S.E.2d 416, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 42 (2017). Sentence not excessive.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing four years of active incarceration on defendants accessory after the fact to first-degree murder convicti on because the sentence was within the range set by the legislature and the record showed that the court expressly considered mitigating evidence, including his youth. Balanced against this evidence were the deceaseds senseless death and the impact i t had on his family, as well as defendants agreement to keep the gun after the shooting. Breshon Avonte Evins v.

For related discussion, see 1A M.J. Accomplices and Accessories, §§ 2, 8, 9, 10. CASE NOTES It must be shown that a crime has been committed by the principal before the accessory t o the crime can be convicted as such. However, it is not necessary that the principal should be convicted of the basic offense. Snyder v. Commonwealth, 202 Va. 1009, 121 S.E.2d 452, 1961 Va. LEXIS 209 (1961); Sult v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 915, 275 S.E.2d 608, 1981 Va. LEXIS 228 (1981). Although conviction of a principal in the first degree is not a condition precedent to conviction of an accessory, before the accessory to a crime can be convicte d as such, it must be shown that the crime has been committed by the principal.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 4A M.J. Conspiracy, §§ 2-4, 7-10; 7B M.J. Evidence, § 284. CASE NOTES This section must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth. Cartwright v. Commonwea lth, 223 Va. 368, 288 S.E.2d 491, 1982 Va. LEXIS 212 (1982). Definition.  Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons by some concerted action to commit an offense. Falden v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 542, 189 S.E. 326, 1937 Va. LEXIS 294 (1937); Cartwright v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 368, 288 S.E.2d 491, 1982 Va. LEXIS 212 (1982). In Virginia, the crime of conspiracy is complete when the parties agree to commit an off ense. Gray v. Commonwealth, 260 Va. 675, 537 S.E.2d 862, 2000 Va. LEXIS 141 (2000). A conspiracy is committed when the agreement to commit the offense is complete and no ov ert act in furtherance of the underlying crime is necessary. Stevens v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 238, 415 S.E.2d 881, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2557, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 109 (1992). Commonwealth must prove an agreement was made.  In order to prove a conspiracy to distribute heroin, the Commonwealth is required to prove an agreement between defendant and another person to do so; if the Comm onwealth fails to produce such evidence, defendants false testimony alone cannot support his conviction. Cosby v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2005). Shared inten t may not be inferred from mere proximity.  In a prosecution for conspiracy to distribute heroin, the fact finder may not infer the shared intent necessary to an agreement from mere proximity and eyeshot. Cosby v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2005). Intent to cooperate in a joint venture .  In a prosecution for conspiracy to distribute heroin, the fact finder may not infer an intent to cooperate in a joint venture from the mere possession of partial proceeds from a sale. Cosby v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2005). Two reasons have been given for making conspiracy illegal: one is to punish the special dangers inherent in group criminal activity, and the second is to permit preventive steps against those who show a disposition to commit crime. Cartwright v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 368, 288 S.E.2d 491, 1982 Va. LEXIS 212 (1982). A single agreement can form the basis for multiple violations of this section. Cartwright v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 368, 288 S.E.2d 491, 1982 Va. LEXIS 212 (1982). Single agreement enc ompassing multiple crimes.  When a single agreement encompasses multiple crimes that are different and have different punishments, a single agreement can be punished as multiple conspiracies , one for each offense contemplated. Smallwood v. Commonwealth, 72 Va. App. 119, 841 S.E.2d 881, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 144 (2020). Single, continuous conspiracy.  Sufficient evidence proved that defendants actions in Spotsylvania and Caroline Counties were acts in furtherance of a single, continuous conspiracy and that venue was proper in Caroline County since: (1) the entire agreement between codefendant and defendant lasted only a short period; (2) codefendant and defendant committed acts in furtherance of the conspiracy in Caroline County by continuing to evade the police in Caroline County; and (3) the escape and chase occurred in a limited area, overlapping two contiguous counties, set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force through several jurisdictions. Chambliss v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. App. 459, 749 S.E.2d 212, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 293 (2013). Single plan.  Defendant and his co-conspirator targeted many people and the fact that the plan required multiple victims to work also suggested a single plan; as the circuit co urt found that there was only a single agreement, it should have only convicted defendant of one count of conspiracy to obtain money by false pretenses and sentenced him accordingly.

Prosecution for conspiracy to commit robbery barred where previous acquittal of underlying robbery.  Defendants prosecution for conspiracy to commit robbery was barred under principles of double jeopardy where defendant had previously been acquitted of the un derlying robbery.

Ca se fell within third party exception to Whartons Rule.  Case involving prosecution for conspiracy to distribute heroin fell within the recognized third party exception to Whartons Rule, where the number of conspirators exceeded the essential participants in the contemplated crime. Brown v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 73, 390 S.E.2d 386, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1786, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 46 (1990).

Applicability of Whartons Rule. .  Whartons Rule did not operate to bar defendants conviction and punishment under § 18.2-22 for conspiracy to commit murder; defendants reliance on the fact that she was convicted of murder under a theory of accomplice liability was misplaced, as the foc us was on the underlying criminal act of the...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-23"><akn:num>§ 18.2-23</akn:num><akn:heading>Conspiring to trespass or commit larceny</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. If any pers on shall conspire, confederate or combine with another or others in the Commonwealth to go upon or remain upon the lands, buildings or premises of another, or any part, portion or area thereof, having knowledge that any of them have been forbidden, eithe r orally or in writing, to do so by the owner, lessee, custodian or other person lawfully in charge thereof, or having knowledge that any of them have been forbidden to do so by a sign or signs posted on such lands, buildings, premises or part, portion o r area thereof at a place or places where it or they may reasonably be seen, he shall be deemed guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor. B. If any pers on shall conspire, confederate or combine with another or others in the Commonwealth to commit larceny or counsel, assist, aid or abet another in the performance of a larceny, where the aggregate value of the goods or merchandise involved is $1,000 or mo re, he is guilty of a felony punishable by confinement in a state correctional facility for not less than one year nor more than 20 years.

Conspiracy, §§ 2, 8. CASE NOTES Evidence sufficient to suppo rt conviction.  Evidence supported a finding that defendant and two accomplices had agreed to commit grand larceny in violation of subsection B of § 18.2-23 and § 18.2-95 because testimony revealed that they were in a store, together, for one-and-a-half hours, taking merchandise and thereafter concealing the merchandise, and the trial court could properly infer that defendant and the accomplices, prior to entering the st ore, agreed upon a course of action that would provide the means to conceal the merchandise to be stolen from the store; because the evidence proved conspiracy, and the aggregate value of the merchandise concealed by defendant and the accomplices exceede d $200, the trial court did not err in convicting defendant of grand larceny. Brown v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 299 (Va. Ct. App. July 27, 2010). Evidence that defendant and a companion went to the mall together, walked through the mall with shopping bags from stores outside the mall and entered the departm ent store, picked up items and carried them into the fitting room, and exited the store with unpaid for items, and that security sensors were found in the companions fitting room was sufficient to support defendants conviction for conspiracy to c ommit grand larceny. Velez-Suarez v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 269, 767 S.E.2d 715, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 27 (2015). Value of stolen goods not shown.  Commonwealth failed to establish the value, either market value or current value, of the stolen copper pipes, a necessary element of grand larceny, conspiracy to commit grand larceny, larceny of property belonging to another with a value of $200 or more with the intent to sell or distribute such property, and conspiracy to commit larceny with the intent to sell or distribute. Grimes v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. App. 4 70, 749 S.E.2d 218, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 302 (2013), aff'd, 288 Va. 314, 764 S.E.2d 262, 2014 Va. LEXIS 147 (2014). § 18.2-23.1. Completed substantive offense bars conviction for conspiracy. Text Notwithstanding any other provision of this article or of § 18.2-256, in any case where a defendant has been tried and convicted of an act he has also conspired to c ommit, such defendant shall be subject to conviction only for the completed substantive offense and not thereafter be convicted for the underlying conspiracy.

Conspiracy, § 4; 6B M.J. Drugs and Druggists, § 5. CASE NOTES Presumption of prospective appli cation.  There are no words in this section which can be construed as legislative intent to override the presumption that new laws are to be prospective in their operation . Shilling v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 500, 359 S.E.2d 311, 4 Va. Law Rep. 190, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 205 (1987). Even if this section applied retroactively, there was sufficient evidence to convict the defendant of distribution and conspiracy to distribute a controlled substan ce, where the indictments were tried simultaneously and the evidence concerning all three indictments was heard by the jury at the same time, no objection was raised that the tri al court failed to instruct the jury that evidence relating to the distribution charges should not have been considered in arriving at its verdict on the conspiracy charge, and if the defendant had made that request of the trial judge and it was granted, the conspiracy conviction could have been supported by the evidence of the defendants actions for which no substantive offense charges were brought. Shilling v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 500, 359 S.E.2d 311, 4 Va. Law Rep. 190, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 20 5 (1987). Ap plication of section to offenses prior to effective date.  Since the effect of this section is to mitigate punishment by barring conviction for the underlying conspiracy if a defendant has been convicted of the completed substantive offense, the Commonwealths consent was necessary for application of this section to a defendants trial on offenses that occurred prior to the effective date of this section. Naito v. Commonwealth, No. 1421-86-4 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 22 , 1988). This section is a substantive penal provision which must be further construed with § 1-16. Naito v. Commonwealth, No. 1421-86-4 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 22, 1988). This section does not prescribe a mode of trial conduct, and the fact that it may be ass erted in the course of trial proceedings does not make it a procedural provision. Naito v. Commonwealth, No. 1421-86-4 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 22, 1988). The word thereafter, as used in this section, means at a subsequent trial,  and does not mean just any moment of time subsequent to conviction of the substantive offense. Boyd v. Commonwealth, 236 Va. 346, 374 S.E.2d 301, 5 Va. Law Rep. 956, 1988 Va. LEXIS 145 (1988). Conspiracy convictions not barred where based on separate acts from substantive conviction.  A conviction for distribution of narcotics did not bar a subsequent prosecution of the same defendant for conspiracies to distribute narcotics on dates different from that of the distribution conviction; the distribution conviction was not a bar to the conspiracy convictions, as the conspiracy convictions did not involve the particular acts upon which the substantive conviction was based. However, as there was o ne overall, ongoing conspiracy encompassing various transactions, the second conspiracy prosecution was barred under principles of double jeopardy. Bowman v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 259, 397 S.E.2d 886, 7 Va. Law Rep. 683, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 191 (1990 ). Conviction of substantive offense and conspiracy in same trial not prohibited.  This section bars conviction for conspiracy in a subsequent trial after an earlier conviction for the substantive offense; this section does not prohibit, however , conviction of both the completed substantive offense and the underlying conspiracy, provided the convictions occur in a single trial, regardless of the order in which the trial court announced the convictions.

Prosecution. A. Indictment. B. Evidence. C. Verdict. I.General Consideration. Legislative intent as to phrase an offense which is punishable with death.  The General Assembly intended the phrase an offense which is punishable with death to incorporate by reference the substantive offenses to which the highe st penalty for attempt would attach. Evans v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 694, 204 S.E.2d 413, 1974 Va. LEXIS 205 (1974). Attempt penalty not dependent on existence of death penalty.  There was no legislative intent to make the attempt penalty dependent upon the existence or nonexistence of the death penalty attached to the substantive offenses incorporated by reference. Evans v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 694, 204 S.E.2d 413, 1974 Va. LEXIS 205 (1974). An attempt is an offense of a lower grade than the consummated felony.  The intention to commit a felony, and the doing of some act towards its commission without actually committing it, is an attempt and is, from its very nature, an offense of a lower grade than the consummated felony. Cates v. Commonwealth, 111 Va. 837, 69 S.E. 520, 1910 Va. LEXIS 84 (1910). This article supersedes the common law.  This article, providing for punishment for attempts to commit crime, supersedes the common law. But it does not change the common law as to the grade of the offen se, so far as murder is concerned, except as to murder in the first degree. Lee v. Commonwealth, 144 Va. 594, 131 S.E. 212, 1926 Va. LEXIS 274 (1926). But does not change the common-law definition of attempt. Merritt v. Commonwealth, 164 Va . 653, 180 S.E. 395, 1935 Va. LEXIS 238 (1935). For this article does not undertake to state what shall constitute an attempt to commit a crime. Merritt v. Commonwealth, 164 Va. 653, 180 S.E. 395, 1935 Va. LEXIS 238 (1935). Double jeopardy considerations.  Section 19.2-294 is not a bar to prosecution for attempted murder after a conviction of obstructing justice; while obstructing justice may be a statutory offense, attempted murder is a common-law offense. Martin v. Commonwealth, 242 Va. 1, 406 S.E.2d 15, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2757, 1991 Va. LEXIS 111, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 945, 112 S. Ct. 388, 116 L. Ed. 2d 339, 1991 U.S. LEXIS 6485 (1991). Where defendant was first convicted of, inter alia, obstruction of justice by threats or force (a misdemeanor) and later convicted of attempted murder (a felony), the same conduct rule enunciated in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508, 110 S. Ct. 2084, 109 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1990), did not apply to bar prosecution of the charge of attempted murder on principles of double jeopardy. Martin v. Commonwealth, 242 Va. 1 , 406 S.E.2d 15, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2757, 1991 Va. LEXIS 111, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 945, 112 S. Ct. 388, 116 L. Ed. 2d 339, 1991 U.S. LEXIS 6485 (1991). Multiple punishments for the crimes of attempted murder and malicious wounding do not violate the double jeopardy clause when the convictions are obtained in a si ngle trial. Creamer v. Commonwealth, No. 1298-91-3 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 15, 1992). Defendants conviction in city for the rape that occurred there did not bar proof of that rape as a predicate offense in his prosecution in neighboring county for attempted capital murder. Curtis v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 622, 414 S.E.2d 421, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2050, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 50 (1992). Double jeopardy not a bar.  Defendants double jeopardy rights were not violated in a case where defendant pled guilty to solicitation to commit murder in violation of § 18.2-29 and a jury then convicted defendant in a trial of attempted capital murder for hire in violation of subdivision 2 of § 18.2-31 and § 18.2-25. Double jeopardy did not apply because: (1) defendants offenses were considered in a single proceeding and, t hus, there were not successive prosecutions for the same offense; and (2) solicitation to commit murder and attempted capital murder for hire were not the same offenses and, thus, defendant could be convicted and punished for both offenses since solicita tion for murder required that a defendant solicit another person whereas attempted capital murder for hire did not require such proof. Ostrander v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 386, 658 S.E.2d 346, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 126 (2008). II.Elements Of Attempt. Common law.  While the punishments for attempts to commit felonies are fixed by statute, what constitutes an attempt must be ascertained from the common law. Johnson v. Common wealth, 209 Va. 291, 163 S.E.2d 570, 1968 Va. LEXIS 229 (1968). An attempt consists of intent plus a direct act.  An attempt to commit a crime consists of: (1) the intent; (2) a direct, ineffectual act towards its commission; and that act must reach far enough towards the acc omplishment of the desired result to amount to the commencement of the consummation. Hicks v. Commonwealth, 86 Va. 223, 9 S.E. 1024, 1889 Va. LEXIS 29 (1889); Barrett v. Commonwealth, 210 Va. 153, 169 S.E.2d 449, 1969 Va. LEXIS 213 (1969); Sizemore v. Co mmonwealth, 218 Va. 980, 243 S.E.2d 212, 1978 Va. LEXIS 255 (1978). An attempt in criminal law is an unfinished crime and is composed of two elements, the intent to commit the crime and the doing of some direct act toward its cons ummation, but falling short of the accomplishment of the ultimate design. Martin v. Commonwealth, 195 Va. 1107, 81 S.E.2d 574, 1954 Va. LEXIS 189 (1954); Johnson v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 291, 163 S.E.2d 570, 1968 Va. LEXIS 229 (1968). Intent necessary.  A person cannot be guilty of an attempt to commit murder unless he has a specific intent to kill. Merritt v. Commonwealth, 164 Va. 653, 180 S.E. 395, 1935 Va. LEX IS 238 (1935). The necessary intent is the intent in fact, as distinguished from an intent in law. Epps v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 150, 216 S.E.2d 64, 1975 Va. LEXIS 260 (1975); N obles v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 548, 238 S.E.2d 808, 1977 Va. LEXIS 290 (1977). Under this article attempt embraces the full meaning of intent, and may be, and frequently is, shown by circumstances. It is a state of mind which may be proved by a persons conduct or by his statements. Barrett v. Commonwealth, 210 Va. 153, 169 S.E.2d 449, 1969 Va. LEXIS 213 (1969); Nobles v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 548, 238 S.E.2d 808, 1977 Va. LEXIS 290 (1977). Intent in fact is the purpose formed in a persons mind which may be shown by his conduct. Epps v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 150, 216 S.E.2d 64, 1975 Va. LEXIS 260 (1975). State of mind is the subject of any inquiry concerning whether an intent to kill exists in an attempted murder case. Nobles v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 548, 238 S.E. 2d 808, 1977 Va. LEXIS 290 (1977). Presumption of intention .  A person is presumed to intend the immediate, direct, and necessary consequences of his voluntary act. Nobles v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 548, 238 S.E.2d 808, 1977 V a. LEXIS 290 (1977). Whether the required intent exists is generally a question for the trier of fact. Nobles v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 548, 238 S.E.2d 808, 1977 Va. LEXIS 290 (1977). Preparation and attempt distinguished.  Preparation consists in devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission of the offense and the attempt is a direct movement towards the c ommission after the preparations are made. Martin v. Commonwealth, 195 Va. 1107, 81 S.E.2d 574, 1954 Va. LEXIS 189 (1954). The act must amount to the commencement of the consummation.  The act must reach far enough towards the accomplishment of the desired result to amount to the com...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-26"><akn:num>§ 18.2-26</akn:num><akn:heading>Attempts to commit felonies other than Class 1 felony offenses; how punished</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Except as provided in § 18.2-25, every person who attempts to commit an offense that is a felony shall be punished as follows: (1) If t he felony attempted is punishable by a maximum punishment of life imprisonment or a term of years in excess of twenty years, an attempt thereat shall be punishable as a Class 4 felony.

CASE NOTES Double jeopardy considerations.  Multiple punishments for the crimes of attempted murder and malicious wounding do not violate the double jeopardy clause when the convictions are obtained in a si ngle trial. Creamer v. Commonwealth, No. 1298-91-3 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 15, 1992). Proof of attempted murder does not require proof of an actual injury, and therefore aggravated malicious wounding and attempted murder each contain an element not contained by the other, and neither crime is a lesser-included offense of the other for double jeopardy purposes. Dennis v. Commonwealth, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 583 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 19, 1999). Defendants double jeopardy rights were not violated by convicting him of two counts of attempted murder as each of defendants attacks on the victim could stand on its own as a separate, complete attempt to murder her because, during the first attack, defendant accelerated his car and aimed the vehicle directly at the victim, and his acceleration of his car toward the victim was a direct, unequivocal act t oward the commission of murder; and defendants second attack on the victim with a hammer was a separate attempt to murder her as the hammer attack did not involve a continuation of the motion involved in trying to run over the victim with a vehicle; instead, the hammer attack involved a new formation and execution of purpose. Jin v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 294, 795 S.E.2d 918, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 34 (2017). The word punishable, as here used, means the maximum punishment which may be imp osed. Slusher v. Commonwealth, 196 Va. 440, 83 S.E.2d 719, 1954 Va. LEXIS 238 (1954). No retroactive assignment of pun ishment.  Although the amendments to this section subsequent to defendants misconduct included attempts at § 18.2-32 offenses, the revised statute may not retroactiv ely assign punishment to prior acts. Cook v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 510, 458 S.E.2d 317, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 528 (1995). No error in indictment amendment which substituted § 18.2-257 for this section.  Where prior to trial, the trial court granted the Commonwealths motion to amend the second count of indictment, thereby changing the attempt statute on which the Commonwealth was relying from this section, the general attempt statute, to § 18.2-257, which covers attempts to violate the Drug Control Act, the trial court did not err in granting the Commonwealths motion to amend the indictment against de fendant. The amendment did not change the nature or character of the offense charged; it merely substituted reference to § 18.2-257, the specific provision covering attempts to commit drug offenses, for this section, the general provision covering at tempts to commit general, non-capital felonies. Robinson v. Commonwealth, No. 1840-90-1 (Ct. of Appeals July 21, 1992). Conviction for conduct not constituting crime.  This section, at the time of defendants offense, did not provide a punishment for an attempted felony which was punishable by confinement for a maximum of 40 years. Thus, although defendants conduct may have been proscribed by § 18.2-32, it was an offense without a penalty. Therefore, defendant was convicted for conduct which constituted no crime at the time of the offense. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was reversed. Cook v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 510, 458 S.E.2d 317, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 528 (1995). Instructions which permitted the jury to find defendant guilty of attempted murder in ei ther first or second degree, and set forth the punishment for either offense, were not confusing and prejudicial on the ground that in Virginia there are no specific offenses for varying degrees of attempted murder. Even though there are no speci fic statutory provisions which establish the degrees of attempted murder, the statutes set forth the punishment for attempts to commit noncapital offenses. Martin v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 847, 234 S.E.2d 62, 1977 Va. LEXIS 246 (1977). Jury instructions.  Trial court did not err in refusing to give a jury instruction on assault during defendants trial for attempted robbery because assault was not a lesser-inclu ded offense of robbery or attempted robbery; because assault contains an element that robbery does not, to wit, words alone cannot constitute assault, yet words alone can create sufficient intimidation to constitute robbery, assault cannot be a lesser-in cluded offense of robbery. Adeniran v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. App. 617, 761 S.E.2d 782, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 281 (2014). The defendants statement that he was going to shoot the victim and take his money was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to rob the victim. Furthermore, the defendant committed numerous overt acts in furtherance of the robbery by placing his hand in his pocket in a manner that caused the victim to believe th at he had a gun, following the victim into the store and stating that he did not want anybody to get hurt, and attempting to enter the taxi after leaving the store. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendants conviction for attempted robbery. Chrisman v. Commonwealth, No. 1724-95-3 (Ct. of Appeals April 30, 1996). Attempted robbery.  Evidence was sufficient to show that defendant committed an overt act for purposes of attempted robbery under §§ 18.2-26 and 18.2-58 where: (1) defendant an d his co-defendant talked about robbing a bank the day before; (2) defendant drove to a remote location in town; (3) the two pulled bandanas over their faces outside the bank; (4) defendant carried a knapsack with his hand inside, and the two men walked toward the entrance to the bank; and (5) when they made eye contact with the witness, they pulled down the masks, but continued walking toward the entrance to the bank, where they paused at the entrance, but at the last minute, aborted their plan and wal ked away. Williams v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 154 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 6, 2004). In an attempted robbery prosecution, where defendant and his companions intended to rob some people in a house, demanded money from the persons they found in the house, and shot and killed a man who later entered, the evidence had been insufficient to convict defendant of attempting to rob this man, as the evidence showed he never formed an intent to rob him, and that he and companions took no action towa rd realizing the ultimate purpose of robbing him. Lewis v. Commonwealth, 43 Va. App. 126, 596 S.E.2d 542, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 252 (2004), rev'd, 269 Va. 209, 608 S.E.2d 907, 2005 Va. LEXIS 22 (2005). Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction for attempted robbery where an accomplice testified that the accomplice approached the passenger side of a vehicle to buy drugs, defendant pulled out a gun by the drivers side of the vehicle, the accomplice ran, but heard the sound of gunshots, and the accomplices testimony was corroborated by the presence of the accomplices fingerprints on the passenger side of the vehicle.

Annotations CASE NOTES Evidence sufficient.  Evidence was sufficient for the trial court to rationally find defendant guilty of attempting to photograph a victim in violation of § 18.2-386.1 because defen dant was charged with and convicted of attempting to photograph the victim in violation of §§ 18.2-27 and 18.2-386.1, not the completed crime; therefore, it was not necessary for the Commonwealth to prove that defendant, in fact, accomplished d irectly photographing the victim in the proscribed manner under the statute or that defendant actually photographed anything. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 53 Va. App. 599, 673 S.E.2d 923, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 137 (2009). Attempted peti t larceny qualifies as third offense.  Attempted petit larceny conviction qualifies as a felony recidivist third or subsequent offense under § 18.2-104 where the phrase punished as larceny f lows from the language of § 18.2-27 imposing the same punishment for attempted and completed petit larceny, and there is no material difference between the phrase punished as larceny and punishable as larceny. Coleman v.

CASE NOTES This section is designed as a deterrent to a person who, by any means, attempts to persu ade another to commit a felony. Huffman v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 823, 284 S.E.2d 837, 1981 Va. LEXIS 379 (1981). Section is not unconstitutionally vague. Fletcher v. Commonwealth, No. 0405-85 (Ct. of A ppeals Oct. 10, 1986). Section gives noti ce that solicitation is felony.  A person of ordinary intelligence is given notice by this section that solicitation to commit any felony is a crime. Persons of ordinary intelligence need not spe culate or guess as to the nature of the conduct proscribed by this section. They are properly notified that soliciting another to commit a felony is a crime accorded a specific punishment and encompasses the solicitation of all acts which are defined as felonies. Fletcher v. Commonwealth, No. 0405-85 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 10, 1986). Section does not unconstitutionally abridge First Amendment right of free speech. The co nstitutionally guaranteed right of free speech does not extend to statements constituting solicitation to commit a felony in violation of this section. Fletcher v. Commonwealth, No. 0405-85 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 10, 1986). Defendants argument that § 18.2-29, along with § 18.2-361, is unconstitutional because it deters constitutionally protected conduct, in defendants c ase, requesting an act of oral sodomy from an undercover police officer in a public place, had to be rejected, as such speech did not request a legal act, but instead requested an illegal act. Singson v. Commonwealth, 46 Va. App. 724, 621 S.E.2d 682, 200 5 Va. App. LEXIS 452 (2005). Prosecution under statute with more severe penalty held not denial of equal protection.  Defendants right of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment was not denied by being prosecuted under the state statute, on grounds that the penalty fo r the state crime of solicitation to commit a felony is greater than the federal penalty applicable to the National Park Service nuisance regulation, where he made no assertion or showing that he was invidiously singled out for prosecution under the stat e solicitation statute. The fact that a federal statute exists, proscribing the same conduct but providing a lesser penalty range than a state statute, does not create an equal protection deprivation where one is prosecuted under the statute allowing a g reater penalty. Fletcher v. Commonwealth, No. 0405-85 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 10, 1986). Prosecution under this section and § 18.2-361 for a crime committed on federal land does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment right of equal protection even t hough similar conduct is proscribed by federal law and is punishable by lesser penalties. Fletcher v. Commonwealth, No. 0405-85 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 10, 1986). Stat utory scheme did not violate Equal Protection Clause.  The fact that solicitation to commit prostitution, § 18.2-346, is a misdemeanor and is, therefore, considered a less serious crime than solicitation to commit a felony, which includes solicitation to commit sodomy, does not create an impermissible classification between groups of people similarly situated. Therefore, the court rejected the defendants claim that the statutory scheme violated the Equal Prote ction Clause. Branche v. Commonwealth, 25 Va. App. 480, 489 S.E.2d 692, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 570 (1997). No discrimination of one gender where absence of attempts to apprehend other gender.  The police do not intentionally discriminate against one gender by the absence of attempts to detect and apprehend offenders of the other gender, when no evidence is presented that offenders of the other gender are engaged in similar criminal behavior; the defendant offered no evidence that similarly situated females could have been prosecuted but were not. Branche v. Commonwealth, 25 Va. App. 480, 489 S.E.2d 692 , 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 570 (1997). Double jeopardy not a bar.  Defendants double jeopardy rights were not violated in a case where defendant pled guilty to solicitation to commit murder in violation of § 18.2-29 and a jury then convicted defendant in a trial of attempted capital murder for hire in violation of subdivision 2 of § 18.2-31 and § 18.2-25. Double jeopardy did not apply because: (1) defendants offenses were considered in a single proceeding and, t hus, there were not successive prosecutions for the same offense; and (2) solicitation to commit murder and attempted capital murder for hire were not the same offenses and, thus, defendant could be convicted and punished for both offenses since solicita tion for murder required that a defendant solicit another person whereas attempted capital murder for hire did not require such proof. Ostrander v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 386, 658 S.E.2d 346, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 126 (2008). Section does not conflict with federal regulation.  The regulatory provision of this section and former 36 C.F.R. § 50.26(d), pertaining to nuisances and solicitation for immoral purposes on areas under the jur isdiction of the National Park Service, are not in actual conflict, even though they contain disparate penalty provisions. In fact, such differing penalty provisions exist routinely, and their coexistence has withstood constitutional scrutiny. Fletcher v . Commonwealth, No. 0405-85 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 10, 1986). Gist of offense is incitement.  It is immaterial whether the solicitation is of any effect and whether the crime solicited is in fact committed; the gist of the offense is incitement. Branche v. Commonwealth, 25 Va. App. 480, 489 S.E.2d 692, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 570 (1997). Criminal solicitation involves the attempt of the accused to incite another to commit a criminal offense; it is immaterial whether the solicitation has any effect and whether the crime solicited is in fact committed. Scott v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 173 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 3, 2001). Criminal solicitation involves the attempt of the accused to incite another to commit a criminal offense; it is immaterial whether the solicitation is of any effect and whether the crime solicited is in fact committed as the gist of the offense is incitement. Jeffers v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 111 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 6, 2001). For crime of solicitation to be completed, it is not necessary that the intended conduct approach the moment of an attempt. Therefore, the offense of solicitation was completed once defendant attempted to persuade the plainclothes investigator to commit oral sodomy. Fletcher v. Commonwealth, No. 0405-85 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 10, 1986). Entreaty to perform criminal act exceeded mere statement of desire.  A defendants words and actions were more than an expression of his desire for oral sex and the trial court could have properly concluded that the defendant ex pressed both a desire and entreaty to induce the victim to allow him to sodomize her where, after his initial suggestion had been rebuffed, he asked, Are you sure? and then, in a demanding tone of voice, ordered her to get in his car; the defenda nts entire course of conduct underscored his desire for the victim to act upon his entreaty. Jeffers v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 111 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 6, 2001). Solicitation may comprise a course of conduct, intended to induce another to act, that c ontinues over an extended period. Jeffers v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 111 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 6, 2001). Entrapment was no defense in a prosecution for solicitation to commit murder where the i ntended crime originated in the evil mind of the defendant and police were brought in merely as a means of permitting the original defendant an opportunity to carry out her criminal plan. Huffman v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 823, 284 S.E.2d 837, 1981 Va. LEX IS 379 (1981). Fail ure to prove defendant spoke with intent to induce act.  Where defendants statements were no more than the expression of his own desire and did not constitute a command, entreaty or attempt to persuade either studen t to engage in oral sodomy, and where several minutes after first encounter defendant stated Ill get you, Ill find you, the trial court was plainly wrong in concluding that the Commonwealth had sustained its burden of pr...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-30"><akn:num>§ 18.2-30</akn:num><akn:heading>Murder and manslaughter declared felonies</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Any person who commits aggravated murder, murder of the first degree, murder of the second degree, voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter, is guilty of a f elony.

Jury instruction on justifiable homicide refused.  Defendant, convicted of multiple charges that included a conviction as a principal in the first degree for second-degree murder, in violation of §§ 18.2-30 and 18.2-32, was not entitled to an instruction on theory of justifiable homicide, as defendant was not totally free from fault, where defendant admitted that approaching defendants adversary and threatening him; in addition, defendant was not entitl ed to a voluntary manslaughter instruction, as the evidence did not support defendants argument that defendant shot in the heat of passion and without reflection, where defendants statement to the police reflected deliberation and intent, rather than the heat of passion, and there was a reasonable opportunity to cool.

Commonwealth, 206 Va. 14, 141 S.E.2d 710, 1965 Va. LEXIS 162 (1965). Distinction between crimes in § 18.2-31(d) (now § 18.2-31 4) and this section is plain: To be found guilty of capital murder, a defendant must be proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, not only to have killed during the commission of a robbery, but to have killed willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation and while armed with a deadly weapon. The defendant found guilty of first degree murder is the defendant who killed during the course of a robbery, but did not kill with willfulness, deliberation, and premeditation. Briley v. Bass, 584 F. Supp. 807, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17 463 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 742 F.2d 155, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 19244 (4th Cir. 1984). Murder is the unlawful killing of another with malice. Robertson v. Commonwealth, 20 S.E. 362, 1894 Va. LEXIS 89 (Va. 1894). Whoever kills a human being with malice aforethought is guilty of murder. Stapleton v. Commonwealth, 123 Va. 825, 96 S.E. 801, 1918 Va. LEXIS 72 (1918). Murder is where a man of sound sense unlawfully kills another with malice aforethought, either express or implied. Harrison v. Commonwealth, 79 Va. 374, 1884 Va. LEXIS 92 (1884). Murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another with malice aforethought. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560, 1979 U.S. LEXI S 10 (1979), limited, Clair v. Calderon, No. CV 93-1133-GLT, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24395 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2000), limited, Soto v. Truitt, No. 96 C 5680, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1750 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 5, 2023). And it is murder even though deceased might have recovered but f or improper treatment.  If the prisoner willfully inflicted upon the deceased a dangerous wound, one that was calculated to endanger and destroy life, and death ensued therefrom within a year and a day, the prisoner is nonetheless responsible for the result although it may appear that the deceased might have recovered but for the aggravation of the wound by unskillful or improper treatment. Clark v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 360, 18 S.E. 441 (1893). But it is not murder when wound quickens progress of fatal disease.  Where in a cause of homicide it appeared that a wound or beating was inflicted on the deceased which was not mortal and the deceased, while laboring under the eff ect of the violence, became sick of a disease not caused by such violence, from which disease death ensued within a year and a day, the party charged with the homicide was not criminally responsible for the death, although it also appeared that the sympt oms of the disease were aggravated, and the fatal progress quickened, by the enfeebled or irritated condition of the deceased, caused by the violence. Livingston v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 592, 1857 Va. LEXIS 11 (1857). Doctrine of transferred intent.  Under the doctrine of transferred intent, if an accused shoots at another intending to kill him, and a third person is killed because of the act, that same intent follows the bullet and is transferred to the killing of the third person, even if such death was accidental or unintentional. Riddick v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 244, 308 S.E.2d 117, 1983 Va. LEXIS 312 (1983). When intent required.  To commit murder one need not intend to take a life; but to be guilty of an attempt to murder he must so intend. It is not sufficient that his act, had it been fa tal, would have been murder. Goodson v. Commonwealth, 22 Va. App. 61, 467 S.E.2d 848, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (1996). To sustain a conviction for attempted murder, the evidence must establish a specific int ent to kill the victim, as well as an overt but ineffectual act committed in furtherance of this criminal purpose. Parrott v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 253 (Va. Ct. App. May 15, 2001). Felony-mur der defined.  Murder, for purposes of felony-murder under this section, is common-law murder coupled with the contemporaneous commission or attempted commission of one of the l isted felonies. Wooden v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 758, 284 S.E.2d 811, 1981 Va. LEXIS 371 (1981). Although felony-murder is a statutory offense, it includes the elements of common-law murder. Wooden v.

CASE NOTES Applicability.  This section applies where the initial felony and the accidental killing are parts of one continuous transaction and are closely related in point of time, place a nd causal connection. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 413, 533 S.E.2d 653, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 649 (2000). Under the res gestae rule, which has been adopted in Virginia and represents the prevailing view among other jurisdictions, the felony-murder statute applies wher e the killing is so closely related to the felony in time, place and causal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise. Commonwealth v. Montague, 260 Va. 697, 536 S.E.2d 910, 2000 Va. LEXIS 139 (2000). Purpose.  The purpose of the doctrine of this section was to deter inherently dangerous felonies by holding the felons responsible for the consequences of the felony, wheth er intended or not. While the range of felonies which may be a predicate for the felony-murder conviction has changed, the function of the doctrine is still to elevate to murder a homicide resulting from a felony by imputing malice. King v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 351, 368 S.E.2d 704, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2834, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (1988). In the prosecution of some felonio us act.  The phrase in the prosecution requires proof that the killing resulted from an act which was an integral part of the felony or an act in direct furtheranc e of or necessitated by the felony; where the evidence fails to support a finding that the killing occurred in the prosecution of or in the furtherance of the underlying felony, there is no basis to find that the accidental death was part or a result of the criminal enterprise. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 413, 533 S.E.2d 653, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 649 (2000). Elements of offense.  The required elements of the res gestae rule, i.e., time, place, and causal connection, are stated in the conjunctive and, therefore, all three elements must be e stablished for the felony-murder statute to apply. Commonwealth v. Montague, 260 Va. 697, 536 S.E.2d 910, 2000 Va. LEXIS 139 (2000). The conduct proscribed by this statute involves the substantial risk to human life commo n to all other forms of malicious homicide: intent to kill, intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, or extreme recklessness demonstrating total indifference to human life. Cotton v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 511, 546 S.E.2d 241, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 277 ( 2001). Causation.  One of the most significant factors in defining the scope of the felony-murder involves the causation required between the felony and the death. King v. Commonwea lth, 6 Va. App. 351, 368 S.E.2d 704, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2834, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (1988). Causal connection is not the criterion by which culpability for felony murder is determined; for felony murder to exist, the killer must act with malice, which is imputed to him by his commission of the underlying felony. Barrett v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 693, 530 S.E.2d 437, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 480 (2000). Existence of causal connection determines whether felony murder committed.  In determining whether a felony murder has been committed, the critical factor is the existence of a causal connection between the felony and the accidental killi ng. Davis v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 408, 404 S.E.2d 377, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2474, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 84 (1991). This section and § 18.2-32 codify common-law doctrine of felony-murder. The doctrine was developed to elevate to murder a homicide committed during the course of a felony by imputing malice to the killing. King v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 351, 368 S.E.2d 704, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2834, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (1988). Imputation of malice.  While § 18.2-32 contemplates a killing with malice, the malice intrinsic in the commission of one of the predicate felonies provides the malice prerequisite to a finding that the homicide was murder. The same imputation of malice is implicit in this section which contemplates an accidental killing; the commission of any felonious act during the prosecution of which a death occurs supplies the malice which rais es the incidental homicide to the level of second-degree murder. Heacock v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 397, 323 S.E.2d 90, 1984 Va. LEXIS 317 (1984). The court adopted the Pennsylvania Supreme Courts analysis in Commonwealth v. Redline, 391 Pa. 486, 137 A.2d 472 (1958) that the felony-murder rule provides f or imputing malice to an accidental killing; it does not impute the act of killing. Therefore, if the accidental death, in the absence of imputed malice, would not have been a criminal homicide, then the statute does not elevate it to second-degree murde r and impute culpability for the death to a co-felon. King v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 351, 368 S.E.2d 704, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2834, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (1988). The second degree felony-murder statute in Virginia contemplates a killing with malice. The commission of any felonious act supplies the malice which raises the i ncidental homicide to the level of second-degree murder. It does not follow, however, that any death of any person which occurs during the period in which a felony is being committed will subject the felon to criminal liability under the felony-murder ru le. King v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 351, 368 S.E.2d 704, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2834, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (1988). Where a person engages in felonious activity and homicide results, the malice inherent in the original felony provides the malice necessary to a finding that the homicide was murder. Hickman v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 369, 398 S.E.2d 698, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1061, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 217 (1990), aff'd, 242 Va. 263, 410 S.E.2d 88, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1179, 1991 Va. LEXIS 142 (1991). This section provides that an accidental killing accompanied by some felonious act, other than those specified in §§ 18.2-31 and 18.2-32, will support a sec ond degree murder conviction; in such case, malice is imputed and raises an accidental homicide to the level of second degree murder. Pavlick v. Commonwealth, 25 Va. App. 538, 489 S.E.2d 720, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 567 (1997), different results reached on r eh'g, 27 Va. App. 219, 497 S.E.2d 920, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 238 (1998). Trial court did not err by imputing malice to defendants drunk driving since: (1) § 18.2-33 encompassed all felonious acts not expressly excluded and inclu ded defendants felonious driving while intoxicated; (2) driving while intoxicated or recklessly was a felony considered to be inherently dangerous and by implication presented a substantial risk to life; and (3) the increased risk of death or serious harm occasioned by the commission of defendants felony DWI demonstrated his lack of concern for human life and justified imputing malice. Montano v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 610, 739 S.E.2d 241, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 91 (2013). This section does not create a presumption that shifts the burden of proof to the defend ant; the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt a felony that involved substantial risk to life. Cotton v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 511, 546 S.E.2d 241, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (2001). Homicide within res gestae of initial felony.  It is clear when the homicide is within the res gestae of the initial felony and emanates therefrom, it is committed in the perpetration of that felony. King v. C ommonwealth, 6 Va. App. 351, 368 S.E.2d 704, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2834, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (1988). All criminal participants in the initial felony may be found guilty of the felony-murder so long as the homicide was within the res gestae of the initial felony. Hickman v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 369, 398 S.E.2d 698, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1061, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 217 (1990), aff'd, 242 Va. 263, 410 S.E.2d 88, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1179, 1991 Va. LEXIS 142 (1991). To convict a defendant of felony homicide, there must be a connection between the felony and the death, and the connection must be found within the res gestae doc trine: the death must be related by time, place and causal connection to the commission of the felony. Cotton v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 511, 546 S.E.2d 241, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (2001). Felony child abuse as predicate of fense.  Felony child abuse requires proof that the assailant is a person responsible for the care of a child, and since that requirement of a special relationship is not an element of murder, felony child abuse is not a lesser-included offense of murder; hence, the doctrine of merger does not preclude use of felony child abuse as the predicate offense required to establish felony homicide. Cotton v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 511, 546 S.E.2d 241, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (2001). Evidence was sufficient to find proof of felony child abuse and neglect and felony murder; the temporal connection was not severed simply because defendants t hree-month-ol...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-34"><akn:num>§ 18.2-34</akn:num><akn:heading>Reserved</akn:heading></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-35"><akn:num>§ 18.2-35</akn:num><akn:heading>How voluntary manslaughter punished</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Voluntary manslaughter is punishable as a Class 5 felony.

Homicide, § 135. CASE NOTES Malice is element of murder but not manslaughter.  Malice, a requisite element for murder of any kind, is unnecessary in manslaughter cases and is the touchstone by which murder and manslaughter cases are distingu ished. Essex v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 273, 322 S.E.2d 216, 1984 Va. LEXIS 200 (1984). Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of another, without malice, either express or impli ed. Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 3 Va. (1 Va. Cas.) 116 (1796); King v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 78 (1817); M'Whirt's Case, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 594, 1846 Va. LEXIS 73 (1846); Byrd v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 536, 16 S.E. 727, 1893 Va. LEXIS 71 (1893); Cla rk v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 360, 18 S.E. 440, 1893 Va. LEXIS 61 (1893). And is distinguished from murder by the absence of malice, either express or implied, wh ich is the essence of murder. Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 3 Va. (1 Va. Cas.) 116 (1796); King v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 78 (1817); M'Whirt's Case, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 594, 1846 Va. LEXIS 73 (1846); Briggs v. Commonwealth, 82 Va. 554, 1886 Va. LEXIS 74 (1886) (see Read v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 924 (1872); Moxley v. Commonwealth, 195 Va. 151, 77 S.E.2d 389 (1953)). Such as when death blow struck in heat of combat.  Where defendant and deceased were actually engaged in combat, during the heat of which defendant dealt the blow which caused the death of deceased, such killing i s manslaughter only. King v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 78 (1817) (see Watson v. Commonwealth, 87 Va. 608, 13 S.E. 22, 1891 Va. LEXIS 113 (1891); Horton v. Commonwealth, 99 Va. 848, 38 S.E. 184, 1901 Va. LEXIS 109 (1901). There can be a principal in the second degree to the offense of manslaughter. Campbell v. Commonwealth, 130 Va. 741, 107 S.E. 812, 1921 Va. LEXIS 189 (1921)See § 18.2-18 . There was ample evidence from which a jury could have reasonably found that defendant was a principal in the second degree in violation of § 18.2-35 because b y the defendants words, gestures, and actions, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, defendant explicitly demonstrated that the defendant shared a friends criminal intent to kill the victim; immediately prior to the killing, def endant specifically commanded the friend to shoot the victim and did nothing to dissuade the friend. McKinney v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 344 (Va. Ct. App. July 8, 2008). Voluntary manslaughter defined.  Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of another without malice actual or implied, upon a sudden heat, on reasonable provocation, or in mutual combat. Ki ng v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 78 (1817). Mutual combat supporting voluntary manslaughter conviction absent where although defenda nt arguably brought about the difficulty that eventually led to the shootout by taking the victims cocaine, he attempted several times to prevent the violence that ultimately ensued. The mutual voluntariness necessary for such combat was not present. Smith v. Commonwealth, 17 Va. App. 68, 435 S.E.2d 414, 10 Va. Law Rep. 211, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 421 (1993). Provocation and passion must concur. Read v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 924, 1872 V a. LEXIS 71 (1872). And continue till instant of m ortal stroke.  The suspension of reason arising from sudden passion must continue from the time provocation is received to the very instant of the mortal stroke given, for if fr om any circumstances whatever it appears that the party reflected, deliberated, or cooled any time before the fatal stroke was given, or if in legal presumption there was time or opportunity for cooling, the killing will amount to murder. M'Whirt's Case, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 594, 1846 Va. LEXIS 73 (1846) (see Dock v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 909 (1872); Byrd v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 536, 16 S.E. 727 (1893); Campbell v. Commonwealth, 130 Va. 741, 107 S.E. 812 (1921)). Nature of provocation determines if killing is from sudden heat of passion.  The test of whether killing is from the sudden heat of passion is found in the nature and degree of the provocation and the manner in which it is resented. Richar dson v. Commonwealth, 128 Va. 691, 104 S.E. 788, 1920 Va. LEXIS 128 (1920) (see Read v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 924 (1872)). And words alone are not sufficient.  Words alone, however insulting or contemptuous, are never a sufficient provocation to have the effect of reducing a homicide to manslaughter, at least where a dea dly weapon is used, so tender is the law of human life and so much opposed is it to the use of such a weapon. Read v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 924, 1872 Va. LEXIS 71 (1872). Successful assertion of self-defense.  Although defendant may have provoked the initial confrontation with the two victims by taking their cocaine, he attempted to withdraw from the conflict several ti mes, and he shot them only when it became necessary to do so in order to save his life or prevent serious bodily injury to him. The danger was real and immediate, and he had no other course available to him. He literally was looking down the barrel of a loaded gun with another assailant standing nearby armed with a cocked pistol. Therefore, defendant was entitled to an acquittal, as a matter of law, on a finding of excusable homicide in self-defense. Smith v. Commonwealth, 17 Va. App. 68, 435 S.E.2d 414 , 10 Va. Law Rep. 211, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 421 (1993). It is no defen se that defendant did not intend to kill.  While neither of defendants in a prosecution for murder may have premeditated the death of deceased, yet where they went with a joint unlawful purpose of attackin g deceased, and deceased was killed in a pistol duel developing out of such attack, the death of deceased was not an improbable consequence of the fight which defendants clearly contemplated, and which the jury, upon ample testimony, evidently believed t hey precipitated. This being true, it matters not that neither of the defendants intended to kill deceased, and a verdict of voluntary manslaughter is warranted. Campbell v. Commonwealth, 130 Va. 741, 107 S.E. 812, 1921 Va. LEXIS 189 (1921). Evidence sufficien t for voluntary manslaughter.  Since the jury could have concluded that the defendant lied during the defendants testimony when the defendant stated that the victim initially attacked the d efendant with the knife that the defendant used to stab the victim, and the victim, who either never had a knife, or had lost the knife, was stabbed four times, the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of voluntary manslaughter under § 18. 2-35. Caison v. Commonwealth, 52 Va. App. 423, 663 S.E.2d 553, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 361 (2008). Conviction upheld.  Appellate court could not conclude that no rational factfinder could have found defendant guilty of second-degree murder, and defendant was not prejudiced by the jurys reluctance to convict her of murder. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to a reversal of her voluntary manslaughter conviction or a new trial. Smith v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 399, 808 S.E.2d 848, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 8, aff'd, 296 Va. 450, 821 S.E.2d 543, 2018 Va. LEXIS 183 (2018), aff'd, No. 180198, 2018 Va. LEXIS 210 (Va. Dec. 13, 2018). Jury instruction to the effect that the accused had the burden of proving self-defense t o the extent of raising in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt as to whether or not he acted in the lawful exercise of such right was constitutional. Frazier v. Weatherholtz, 572 F.2d 994, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 12420 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S . 876, 99 S. Ct. 215, 58 L. Ed. 2d 191, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 3235 (1978). Trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on justified self-defense and defense of others, because there was no evidence to support such instructions; alt hough defendant and his wife testified that the victim was yelling and screaming cruel obscenities in the face of defendants wife, such behavior did not constitute an overt act indicative of imminent danger entitling defendant to the proffered defens e theories. Garrard v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 376 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 21, 2010). Sentence upheld.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion following defendants guilty pleas to voluntary manslaughter, shooting in the commission of a felony, and two counts o f unlawfully discharging a firearm in an occupied building in imposing a fifteen-year sentence with five years suspended, which did not exceed the statutory maximum, because the proffer contained facts from which the court could have found that defendant exhibited both premeditation and malice in getting a gun and returning to twice shoot defendants spouse during a dispute in their home.

Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of one accidentally contrary to the intention of the parties, in the prosecution of some unlawful, but not felonious act; or in the improper performance of a lawful act. Commonwealth v. Jones, 28 Va. (1 Leigh) 598, 1829 Va. LEXIS 59 (1829); Souther v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. (7 Gratt.) 673, 1851 Va. LEXI S 28 (1851) (see also MWhirts Case, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 594 (1846); Byrd v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 536, 16 S.E. 727 (1893); Fadely v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 198, 156 S.E.2d 773 (1967); Lewis v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 684, 179 S.E.2d 506 (1971); Gooden v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 565, 311 S.E.2d 780 (1984)). Criminal neg ligence is element of offense.  Criminal negligence is the basis for involuntary manslaughter and has been defined as acting consciously in disregard of another persons rights or acting with reckless indifference to the consequences, with the defendant aware, from his knowledge of existing circumstances and conditions, that his conduct probably would cause injury to another. Gray v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 548 (Va. Ct. App. July 2 5, 2000). Criminal negligence is acting consciously in disregard of another persons rights or acting with reckless indifference to the consequences, with the defendant aware, from his knowledge of existing circumstances and conditions, that his conduct probably would cause injury to another. Craig v. Commonwealth, 34 Va. App. 155, 538 S.E.2d 355, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 837 (2000). Knowledge is element of offens e.  To be guilty of involuntary manslaughter, a defendant must have had prior knowledge of specific conditions that would likely cause injury to others. Gray v. Commo nwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 548 (Va. Ct. App. July 25, 2000). Intentional, willful and wanton violation of safety statutes, resulting in death, will justify conviction of involuntary manslaughter. King v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 601, 231 S.E.2d 312, 1977 Va. LEXIS 208 (1977). To convict defendant of involuntary manslaughter the Commonwealth was required to prove that defendant committed acts of commission or omission of a wanton or wilful nature, showing a reckless or indifferent disregard of the rights of others, under circumstances reasonably calculated to produce injury, or which make it not improbable that i njury will be occasioned, and the offender knows, or is charged with the knowledge of, the probable result of his acts. Gallimore v. Commonwealth, 246 Va. 441, 436 S.E.2d 421, 10 Va. Law Rep. 470, 1993 Va. LEXIS 150 (1993). To support an involuntary manslaughter conviction, the Commonwealth must prove a homicide was not improbable under all of the facts existing at the time and that the knowledge of such facts should have had an influence on the conduct of the offender. Craig v. Commonwealth, 34 Va. App. 155, 538 S.E.2d 355, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 837 (2000). Evidence that defendant left the child in the van and casually instructed other children to get all the children out of the van and into the house without ensurin g that his instructions were obeyed, and that, over a period of more than seven hours, defendant assumed but never ascertained that the child was asleep in the house was sufficient to show defendants total and utter disregard for her well-being, safe ty, and life and thus, to support convictions for involuntary manslaughter and felony child neglect. Kelly v. Commonwealth, 42 Va. App. 347, 592 S.E.2d 353, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 47 (2004). Objective awareness test.  Whether a defendant knows of the dangerous risk she or he causes is measured by an objective awareness test  whether the defendant knew or should have known of the risk her or his conduct created. Gallimore v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 288, 422 S.E.2d 613, 9 Va. Law Rep. 444, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 271 (1992), aff'd, 246 Va. 441, 436 S.E.2d 421, 10 Va. Law Rep. 470, 1993 Va. LEXIS 150 (1993). Criminal negligence, as the basis for involuntary manslaughter, is judged under an objective standard and, therefore, may be found to exist where the offender eit her knew or should have known the probable results of his acts. Craig v. Commonwealth, 34 Va. App. 155, 538 S.E.2d 355, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 837 (2000). Construction with other law.  While the statutory requirements of former § 18.2-268 [now see § 18.2-268.1 et seq.] are to be strictly applied, they apply only to DUI prosecutions under § 18.2-266, and not to an involuntary manslaughter prosecution under this section. Taylor v. Commonwealth, No. 1977-94-4 (Ct. of Appeals July 18, 1995). The improper performance of a lawful act, to constitute involuntary manslaughter , must amount to an unlawful commission of such lawful act, not merely a negligent performance. The negligence must be criminal negligence. Gooden v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 565, 311 S.E.2d 780, 1984 Va. LEXIS 296 (1984). The accidental killing must be the proximate result of a lawful act performed in a manner so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard of human life. Gooden v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 565, 311 S.E.2d 780, 1984 Va. LEXIS 296 (1984). The improper performance of a lawful act proximately causing an accidental killing is insufficient to support a conviction for involuntary manslaughter unless tha t improper performance constitutes criminal negligence. King v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 601, 231 S.E.2d 312, 1977 Va. LEXIS 208 (1977). Showing necessary where charge predicated on improper performance of lawful act.  When the Commonwealth predicates the charge upon an improper performance of a lawful act, it must show that the performance was so improper as to constitute negli gence so gross and culpable as to indicate a callous disregard of human life. But the negligence need not be so gross as to raise the presumption of malice. Beck v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 1, 216 S.E.2d 8, 1975 Va. LEXIS 238 (1975). Where intentional violation of statute involves inherently dangerous act which is the pr oximate cause of the resulting homicide, the killing is involuntary manslaughter. Bailey v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 331, 362 S.E.2d 750, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1409, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 245 (1987). Ma lice is element of murder but not manslaughter.  Malice, a requisite element for murder of any kind, is unnecessary in manslaughter cases and is the touchstone by which murder and manslaughter cases are distingu ished. Essex v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 273, 322 S.E.2d 216, 1984 Va. LEXIS 200 (1984). Reckless conduct must amount to unlawful conduct in order to sustain a charge of involun tary manslaughter; it is immaterial whether the unlawful act was unlawful in its inception  that is, an inherently unlawful act, such as discharging a deadly weapon into a crowded street  or became unlawful after it was begun, such as lawfully op erating a vehicle in a public street but so accelerating its speed that it may cause death or serious bodily harm to persons in that street. Gooden v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 565, 311 S.E.2d 780, 1984 Va. LEXIS 296 (1984). Ordinary negligence is insufficient to convict of involuntary manslaughter.  The degree of negligence must be more than ordinary negligence in order for negligent violation of a safety statute to justify conviction of involuntary manslaugh ter. King v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 601, 231 S.E.2d 312, 1977 Va. LEXIS 208 (1977). In the operation of motor vehicles violation of a safety statute amounting to mere negligence proximately causing an accidental death is not sufficient to support a conviction of involuntary manslaughter. King v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 601, 231 S.E.2d 312, 1977 Va. LEXIS 208 (1977). Where evidence in a criminal prosecution showed at most only an inadvertent failure by the defendant to turn on her white headlights rather than her amber running or parking lights, this act of omission was no more than ordinary negligence, an insufficient predicate for a conviction of involuntary manslaughter. King v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 601, 231 S.E.2d 312, 1977 Va. LEXIS 208 (1977). When the proximate cause of a death is simply ordinary negligence, i.e., the failure to exercise reasonable care, the negligent party cannot be convicted of invol untary manslaughter. To constitute criminal negligence essential to a conviction of involuntary manslaughter, an accuseds conduct must be of such reckless, wanton or flagrant nature as to indicate a callous disregard for human life and of the probabl e consequences of the act. Davis v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 201, 335 S.E.2d 375, 1985 Va. LEXIS 270 (1985). A higher degree of negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle is required to establish criminal liability for involuntary manslaughter than to establish liabi lity in a civil action for ordinary or even gross negligence. This higher degree of negligence has come to be known as criminal negligence. Keech v. Commonwealth, 9 Va. App. 272, 386 S.E.2d 813, 6 Va. Law Rep. 879, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 151 (1989).

Covington v. Commonwealth, 136 Va. 665, 11 6 S.E. 462, 1923 Va. LEXIS 114 (1923). Section changed former rule.  This section changed the rule established by Commonwealth v. Linton, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 205 (1820), in which it was held that if one be stricken within the state, but die of the wound in another state, the offender may be indicted and tried within the state for wounding with intent to maim, disable, etc., but not for murder, and constituted the act of giving a mortal wound in this state which results in death out of the state a statutory offense of murder punishable in this state. By necessary implication from its terms, the statute provided that the venue of such offense should be in the county or corporation in which the stroke was given. Covington v. Commonwe alth, 136 Va. 665, 116 S.E. 462, 1923 Va. LEXIS 114 (1923). § 18.2-37.1. Certain matters not to constitute defenses. Text A.

CASE NOTES Meaning of assemble.  For a group of persons lawfully gathered for whatever purpose to assemble as a mob within the intendment of this section, they need only to collectively b and together with the common purpose and intention of committing an assault and battery upon a person. Harrell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990). Assembled as a mob.  The evidence which proves that a group assembled as a mob may consist solely of proof that characterizes the purpose, circumstances or the setting of the group s initial assemblage. Harrell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990). Proof of what transpired after the original assemblage, when considered in relation to the purpose for which the persons were present, may establish that persons gathered for a lawful purpose assembled as a mob. Harrell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990). Trial court erred in admitting the grand jury testimony of two codefendants to show that defendant assembled as part of a mob in order to show that he was guilty of lynching, but the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of considerable other evidence showing that defendant was part of the mob that attacked a rival gang at a hotel and was responsible for stabbing to death anther person during the attack. Corado v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 315, 623 S.E.2d 452, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 528 (2005). A mob need not have a common motivation or underlying reason for the assault, they need only to collectively band together with the common purpose and intention of committing an assault and battery upon a person. Jones v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 844 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2000). But specific intent must be shown.  Statutory definition of a mob requires that the act of assembling be done for a specific purpose and with a specific intent  to commit an assault or a battery without lawful authority. Hughes v. Commonwealth, 43 Va. App. 391, 598 S.E.2d 743, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 308 (2004). What transforms group into mob.  Whether a group of individuals lawfully assembled has been transformed into a mob depends upon the circumstances; no particular words or express agreement s are required to effect a change in a groups purpose or intentions. Events or emotionally charged circumstances suddenly may focus individuals toward a common goal or purpose without an express or stated call to join forces. Harrell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990). It is possible that individuals who are lawfully assembled may become members of a mob without great deliberation and for them to become part of a group t hat is moved or controlled by those impulsive and irrational forces that perpetuate mob violence. Hughes v. Commonwealth, 43 Va. App. 391, 598 S.E.2d 743, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 308 (2004). Purpose of assembling.  The definition of a mob in this section requires that the act of assembling be done for a specific purpose and with a specific intent  to commit an assault or a battery without lawful authority. Sheikh v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 9, 526 S.E.2d 271, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 197 (2000). Every person in mob criminally cul pable.  Once a group assembled comprises a mob, if the assault or battery which is committed is a simple assault or battery, then under § 18.2-57, every person composi ng the mob becomes criminally culpable even though the member may not have actively encouraged, aided, or countenanced the act. Harrell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990). If a defendant was part of a mob which attacked a victim, then the defendant is criminally culpable for all the acts of the mob even though he may not have active ly encouraged, aided or countenanced the act; criminal accountability flows from being a member of the mob, regardless of whether the member aids and abets in the assault and battery. Jones v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 844 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2000). Indictment using word mob without elaboration is sufficient.  Defendant was charged with being one of a mob and in that capacity with feloniously assaulting another. The lynch law (this section) defines a mob . Therefore, an elaboration in the indictment of these statutory provisions defining a mob is not necessary, as they are too plain for argument and could not possibly have been misunderstood. Hagood v. Commonwealth, 157 Va. 918, 162 S.E. 10, 1932 Va. LEX IS 332 (1932). Statemen t of member of mob at time of assault admissible.  Objection was made to the admissibility in evidence of statements made by a member of the mob at the time of the assault to the effect that the person assaulted h ad run his wife away from home and put her in an institution. It was held that all that was then done and said was part of the res gestae and competent. Hagood v. Commonwealth, 157 Va. 918, 162 S.E. 10, 1932 Va. LEXIS 332 (1932). Evidence sufficient.  Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction for maiming by mob as it showed that the group of men emerged from the McDonalds en masse, follow ed the victim and his friend, surrounding them, and then beat the victim and struck and chased his friend. The evidence also suggested that the group acted in concert to attack the victim following one of the group members stated intent to hit the vi ctim or his friend. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. App. 303, 709 S.E.2d 175, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 185 (2011). Evidence insufficient.  The evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction under § 18.2-41 because the Commonwealth failed to prove that when the defendant committed the battery, h e was a member of a mob assembled with a purpose and intention of committing an assault and battery under this section where the uncontradicted evidence established that the group assembled to attend a neighborhood party, after which many congregated in a boisterous gathering in the street nearby, lingering there for over two hours after the party ended and before the confrontation with the victim. Harrell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990). The circumstantial evidence necessary to prove that a group assembled with a common purpose and intent to commit an assault and battery does not have to be comple tely independent of proving the original purpose for which the group assembled and how they behaved thereafter. Harrell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990). Although a brawl ensued after the patrons of the bowling alley watched appellant argue with man and another person punched man, no evidence proved that appellant joined in any mob that could have formed. Although the evidence would have been sufficient to prove individual assaultive conduct, it was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant acted as part of a mob. Iverson v. Commonwealth, No. 1825-93-1 (Ct. of Appeals June 20, 1995). Although a brawl ensued after the patrons of the bowling alley watched appellants friend argue with man and appellant punched man, no evidence proved that app ellant joined in any mob that could have formed. At best, the Commonwealth proved that appellant hit man and threw more than one chair. Although the evidence would have been sufficient to prove individual assaultive conduct, it was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant acted as part of a mob. Simmons v. Commonwealth, No. 1805-93-1 (Ct. of Appeals June 20, 1995). Where testimony proved that appellant was seen moving to the area where fight was, and although appellant admitted that he threw a chair, the evidence proved that after the fight began many people threw chairs, including people who the Commonwealth conceded were not part of the mob, thus, the fact that appellant threw chairs did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was acting as part of a mob. Wynn v. Comm onwealth, No. 1804-93-1 (Ct. of Appeals June 20, 1995). Evidence failed to prove that group of which defendant was alleged to be a member assembled for specific purpose of maliciously wounding and assaulting victims na med in indictment. Forrester v. Commonwealth, No. 0701-98-2 (Ct. of Appeals June 22, 1999). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS What transforms group into mob.  Even if defendant were originally at an apartment complex to fight a shooting culprit one-on-one, evidence that, once everyone arrived at the apartment, they agre ed to move across the street to handle it indicated that the group, at that time, fell within the definition of a mob as contemplated by § 18.2-38 as the group had transformed into a collection of people who had the intention of committing an assault or battery upon any person or an act of violence. Moreover, the evidence showed that, during the altercation, the victim and the shooting culprit became focused on the common goal of fighting defendant; thus, defendants motion to strike under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:15 was denied. Commonwealth v. Puryear, 2009 Va. Cir.

CASE NOTES Attack on any person.  Trial court did not err in the jury instructions it gave in regard to the lynching charge against defendant; the victim of the attack did not have to be the initi al, specific target of the mob and since the jury instructions correctly stated the law in that regard, the jury was not improperly instructed.

History History. Code 1950, § 18.1-29; 1960, c. 358; 1975, cc. 14, 15. Annotations CASE NOTES Convic tions for felony murder and lynching by mob upheld.  Defendant was not entitled to reversal of convictions for both felony murder and lynching by mob, because both the felony murder statute, § 18.2-32, and the ly nching-by-mob statute, § 18.2-40, included at least one element the other did not, and the appellate court presumed that the General Assembly did not intend either statute to displace the other.

Harrell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990). Assembled as a mob.  The evidence which proves that a group assembled as a mob may consist solely of proof that characterizes the purpose, circumstances or the setting of the group s initial assemblage. Harrell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990). Proof of what transpired after the original assemblage, when considered in relation to the purpose for which the persons were present, may establish that persons gathered for a lawful purpose assembled as a mob.

App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990). Every person in mob criminally cul pable.  Once a group assembled comprises a mob, if the assault or battery which is committed is a simple assault or battery, then under § 18.2-57, every person composi ng the mob becomes criminally culpable even though the member may not have actively encouraged, aided, or countenanced the act. Harrell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990). Double jeopardy.  Defendants convictions for malicious wounding and maiming by mob did not violate principles of double jeopardy as malicious wounding contained an additional e lement not found in maiming by mob, namely that the defendant acted with malice. Thus, it followed that one who was guilty of maiming by mob was not necessarily guilty of malicious wounding. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. App. 303, 709 S.E.2d 175, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 185 (2011). Lesser-included offense.  Assault and battery by a mob, in violation of § 18.2-42, is a lesser-included offense of malicious wounding by a mob, because the only difference between the t wo offenses is the requisite intent, and one cannot have the malicious intent required for the latter offense without also having an intent to do bodily harm, required for the former offense, making the former crime a lesser-included offense of the latte r.

Trial court did not err in refusing to reduce the charge of malicious injury by a mob to a misdemeanor assault by a mob, as the evidence at trial supported a reas onable conclusion that the group of assailants, including attacked the victim with malicious intent. Abandeh v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 80 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 7, 2023). Evidence insufficient.  The evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction under this section because the Commonwealth failed to prove that when the defendant committed the battery, h e was a member of a mob assembled with a purpose and intention of committing an assault and battery under § 18.2-38 where the uncontradicted evidence established that the group assembled to attend a neighborhood party, after which many congregated in a boisterous gathering in the street nearby, lingering there for over two hours after the party ended and before the confrontation with the victim. Harrell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (1990).

Wynn v. Comm onwealth, No. 1804-93-1 (Ct. of Appeals June 20, 1995). Evidence sufficient.  The evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant was a member of a mob for purposes of this section where the defendant met wit h a group of fellow gang members in order to assault another individual, the defendant admitted that they made a plan to seek out the intended victim and to physically assault him and the defendant knew that one of the members of the gang had a rifle and had made repeated statements regarding his intent to kill the person they were seeking. Sheikh v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 9, 526 S.E.2d 271, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 197 (2000). Defendants convictions for malicious wounding while part of a mob under § 18.2-41, and aggravated malicious wounding under § 18.2-51.2 were appropriate because defendant was not permitted to complain on appeal of the trial courts refusal to suppress the very evidence that he elicited on his own behalf. Defendant himself elicited the testimony about his statements to the Security Threat Unit that he was a gang member. Boone v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 37 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 2, 2010). Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction for maiming by mob as it showed that the group of men emerged from the McDonalds en masse, follow ed the victim and his friend, surrounding them, and then beat the victim and struck and chased his friend. The evidence also suggested that the group acted in concert to attack the victim following one of the group members stated intent to hit the vi ctim or his friend. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. App. 303, 709 S.E.2d 175, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 185 (2011). Conviction for maiming by mob under § 18.2-41, was supported by evidence that a mob formed at a club with the specific intent of committing violence and beat t he victim for five minutes, leaving the victim with two fractured vertebrae; the duration of the beating and the gravity of the victims injuries showed that the mob, which included defendant, intended to seriously injure and maim the victim. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. App. 625, 712 S.E.2d 751, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (2011). Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction of wounding by mob because it showed that he and his cousins assembled in the restaurant parking lot to fight the victim, they engaged in a physical altercation with the victim, after the victim shot appellant and his cousin, those two men, rather than leaving the area, remained in the parking lot until the victim returned, and they shot the victim.

Abandeh v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 80 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 7, 2023). Evidence properly admitted as hearsay exception.  Where a witness testified that a third party relayed defendants license plate number to the witness, the evidence of the license plate number was properly adm itted as a present sense impression; as a result, defendants conviction of misdemeanor assault by mob was proper. Brooke v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 104 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 9, 2004). Evidence sufficient.  There was sufficient evidence supporting the jurys decision that defendant participated in the assault and battery of three victims in violation of § 18.2- 42, as a witness who knew defendant saw defendant doing something to one victims back while the victim was on the ground unconscious, and according to the witness, defendant was not trying to help the victim. While the victim was unconscious, the victims back was twice burned with a cigarette. Hamilton v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 487 (Va. Ct.

Abdullah v. Commonwealth, 53 Va. App. 750, 675 S.E.2d 215, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 169 (2009).

Evidence insufficient.  Although a brawl ensued after the patrons of the bowling alley watched appellants friend argue with man and appellant punched man, no evidence proved that app ellant joined in any mob that could have formed. At best, the Commonwealth proved that appellant hit man and threw more than one chair. Although the evidence would have been sufficient to prove individual assaultive conduct, it was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant acted as part of a mob. Simmons v. Commonwealth, No. 1805-93-1 (Ct. of Appeals June 20, 1995). Where testimony proved that appellant was seen moving to the area where fight was, and although appellant admitted that he threw a chair, the evidence proved that after the fight began many people threw chairs, including people who the Commonwealth conceded were not part of the mob, thus, the fact that appellant threw chairs did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was acting as part of a mob. Wynn v. Comm onwealth, No. 1804-93-1 (Ct. of Appeals June 20, 1995). § 18.2-42.1. Acts of violence by mob. Text Any and every person composing a mob which commits an act of violence as defined in § 19.2-297.1 shall be guilty of that act of violence and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided in the section of this title which makes that act of violence unlawful. History History. 1999, c. 623. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 13A M.J. Mobs, Riots and Lynchings, § 4. CASE NOTES Liability of members.  Defendants convictions under § 18.2-53.1 were reversed and dismissed because even though defendant was a member of a mob, § 18.2-42.1 did not render him criminally responsible for using a firearm in the commission of lynching and using a firearm in the commission of malicious wounding by mob simply by being a member of such mob.

LEXIS 326 (1984). This section is not unconstitutionally vague because it does not inform an individual wh ether they can be held in contempt in a court of the Commonwealth or that of a sister state. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 228, 380 S.E.2d 17, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2545, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 56 (1989). Each prohibited act independently sufficient to support conviction.  Because this section casts its several prohibited acts in the disjunctive, each is independently sufficient to support a conviction. Accordingly, the physical det ention of a person, with the intent to deprive him of his personal liberty, by force, intimidation or deception, without any asportation of the victim from one place to another, is sufficient. Scott v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 519, 323 S.E.2d 572, 1984 Va. LEXIS 326 (1984). The abduction statute casts its several prohibited acts in the disjunctive, [and therefore,] each is independently sufficient to support a conviction. Cheng v. Co mmonwealth, 240 Va. 26, 393 S.E.2d 599, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2538, 1990 Va. LEXIS 98 (1990). Robbery, burglary, grand larceny and abduction, are each treated separately and are gove rned by a separate statutory provision. Austin v. Peyton, 279 F. Supp. 227, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8969 (W.D. Va. 1968). Included in offens e defined in § 18.2-48.  The offense defined in this section is an offense lesser-included in the offense defined in § 18.2-48. Hawks v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 244, 321 S.E.2d 650, 1984 Va. LEXIS 195 (1984). Dete ntion of trespasser not legally justified.  The defendant did not have legal justification to confront and detain victims who trespassed onto his property, since the common law has long recognized the right of a landowner to order a trespasser to leave his property, and, should the trespasser refuse, to employ proper force to expel him, but does not allow the landowner to seize or detain a trespasser; thus, the evidence was sufficient to prove that the def endant abducted the victims and used a firearm in the commission of the abductions where the defendant and his brother jumped out of the woods, brandished rifles at the victims, and commanded that they freeze, and then coerced them into going to the defendants house by falsely telling them that the police had been called. Hitchcock v. Commonwealth, No. 1387-97-4 (Ct. of Appeals April 21, 1998). Specific intent.  The distinguishing feature between the offenses of abduction with the intent to deprive such other person of his personal liberty and abduction with i ntent to defile is the specific intent entertained by the accused. McKinley v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 1, 225 S.E.2d 352, 1976 Va. LEXIS 229 (1976) (decided under former §§ 18.1-36 and 18.1-38). Defendant was properly convicted of attempted abduction because the trial court could reasonably infer that his actions were inconsistent with an intent to create a romantic relationship with the victim, and were consistent with attempting to abduct her with the purpose of withholding her personal liberty where defendant initially stood in front of the victim blocking her path, grabbed her jacket, and subsequentl y positioned his truck so that she could not walk around it. Gray v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 83 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 11, 2014). Sufficient evidence showed defendants specific intent to deprive victims of the victims personal liberty because the evidence showed defendant, with the u se of a firearm, intimidated the victims to remain where the victims were and, independently, showed defendant intended to deprive the victims of the victims personal liberty. Commonwealth v. Herring, 288 Va. 59, 758 S.E.2d 225, 2014 Va. LEXIS 94 (20 14). Defendant preserved the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence as to defendants intent to commit abduction because defendant contested the sufficiency of th e evidence according to the statute, which raised such sufficiency as to all statutory elements. Commonwealth v. Herring, 288 Va. 59, 758 S.E.2d 225, 2014 Va. LEXIS 94 (2014). Where the defendant, who was appealing the revocation of his probation, argued that the testimony was insufficient to establish the elements of the Virginia offen se of abduction, his repeated attempts to slow the car and his demands that the victims get out did not preclude a finding that he intended to deprive the victims of their personal liberty. United States v. Sadeghi, 616 Fed. Appx. 607, 2015 U.S. App. LEX IS 11559 (4th Cir. 2015). Based on defendants behavior, statements, and actions, the circuit court reasonably inferred that defendant attempted to re-enter the house through the window using the two-by-four planks with an unlawful purpose. Breakley v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 366 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 16, 2022). Physical detention of a person, with intent to deprive him of his personal liberty, by f orce, intimidation, or deception, without any asportation of the victim from one place to another, is sufficient to support a conviction of abduction. Simms v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 614, 346 S.E.2d 734, 3 Va. Law Rep. 175, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (198 6). Momentary deprivation of liberty furthering sexual advances.  Where defendant put his arms around prosecutrix and held her tightly this was done in furtherance of his sexual advances and not with the intent to deprive her of her personal liberty, although such a deprivation did occur momentarily; thus, the evidence was not sufficient to sustain his conviction of abduction. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 872, 275 S.E.2d 592, 1981 Va. LEXIS 222 (1981). When defendant grabbed the victim around the waist and thrust his pelvic area into her buttocks for about five seconds, the requisite specific intent to deprive t he victim of her personal liberty, sufficient to sustain a charge of abduction under this section, was not present.

CASE NOTES Legislative intent.  Legislative intent of § 18.2-126 is to protect the sanctity of both a burial place and a dead body, wherever situated, and that is not the same intent encompas sed in § 18.2-48; the meaning of defile in subsection B of § 18.2-126 is not limited to the meaning of defile in § 18.2-48. Everett v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 14, 2020). The clear purpose of this section is to punish more severely those who abduct with the i ntent to effectuate the taking of money or its equivalent. Newson v. Commonwealth, No. 1498-90-1 (Ct. of Appeals July 30, 1991). Offense under § 18.2-47 included in offense under this section.  The offense defined in § 18.2-47 is an offense lesser-included in the offense defined in this section. Hawks v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 244, 321 S.E.2d 650, 1984 Va. LEXIS 195 (1984). Specific intent.  The distinguishing feature between the offenses of abduction with the intent to deprive such other person of his personal liberty and abduction with i ntent to defile is the specific intent entertained by the accused. McKinley v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 1, 225 S.E.2d 352, 1976 Va. LEXIS 229 (1976) (decided under former §§ 18.1-36 and 18.1-38). Pecuniary benefit.  The term pecuniary benefit means not only money, but everything that can be valued in money. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 264 (Va. Ct. App . Apr. 11, 2000). Although the evidence supported multiple hypotheses regarding the defendants intent at the time of the abduction, all involved the intent to obtain a pecuniar y benefit  by intending to steal something the defendant found while looking through closets and cabinets in the victims apartment, by taking the car operated by a key he duplicated or by duplicating a key to the bank where one of the victims wor ked in order to rob or facilitate a subsequent bank robbery; in light of this evidence and the absence of any evidence of a prior relationship between the defendant and the victims or any other motive for their abduction, the trier of fact was entitled t o conclude that the defendant did not act merely to deprive the victims of their personal liberty. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 264 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2000). The statutory element is the intent to extort money or obtain a pecuniary benefit; it is not necessary that the criminal actually succeed in realizing his or her desired gain. Barnes v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 130, 360 S.E.2d 196, 4 Va. Law Rep. 522, 1987 Va. LEXIS 254 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1036, 108 S. Ct. 763, 98 L. Ed. 2d 779, 198 8 U.S. LEXIS 428 (1988). Physical detention of a person, with intent to deprive him of his personal liberty, by f orce, intimidation, or deception, without any asportation of the victim from one place to another, is sufficient to support a conviction of abduction. Simms v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 614, 346 S.E.2d 734, 3 Va. Law Rep. 175, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (198 6). Either one of two intents is criminal; the intent to extort money, or pecuniary benefit. There may be an intent to extort money, or the offender may otherwise intend to benefit himself pecuniarily; either is sufficient. Krummert v. Commonwealth, 186 Va. 581, 43 S.E.2d 831, 1947 Va. LEXIS 179 (1947). Use of hostage to escape robbery scene .  Where defendants, by using a hostage as a shield and by threatening to blow him away, safely left the scene of a robbery with stolen money and drugs, they acted with intent to extort or acquire pecuniary benefit for themselves. Cortner v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 557, 281 S.E.2d 908, 1981 Va. LEXIS 343 (1981). Abduction as means of committing robbery.  Abducting a person as a means of gaining access to the scene or otherwise facilitating the commission of an intended robbery violates the statute. Barnes v. Commo nwealth, 234 Va. 130, 360 S.E.2d 196, 4 Va. Law Rep. 522, 1987 Va. LEXIS 254 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1036, 108 S. Ct. 763, 98 L. Ed. 2d 779, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 428 (1988). In a case involving defendants conviction for abduction with the intent to extort money and using a firearm in the commission of a felony, because the victims  detention was no greater than that necessary to carry out two armed robberies of restaurants, the detentions were incidental to, rather than separate and apart from, the underlying robberies. Neither of the victims was forced to move a significant d istance, walking instead from one area of the restaurant to another, and neither of the victims was detained for a significant length of time. Wiggins v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 173, 622 S.E.2d 774, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 507 (2005). Defendant was properly convicted, as a principal in the second degree, of two counts of abduction, three counts of robbery, and five counts of use of firearm in c ommission of a felony because, while defendant remained in the get away vehicle, a cook and a waitress were grabbed and forced into an office and three employees, two assistant managers and a waitress were each subjected to violence and intimidat ion to accomplish the goal of obtaining the money from a safe. Harper v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 328 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 6, 2016). Trial court properly denied defendants motion to strike an abduction charge as incidental to a robbery charge because defendant did not need to move the victi m underneath a stairwell to a darkened alcove to take his possessions and doing so exceeded the minimum restraint necessary to complete the robbery. Conyers v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 362 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 20, 2016). A conviction for abduction in connection with a robbery requires proof of a detention gr eater than the restraint that is intrinsic in a robbery. Abraham v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 22, 526 S.E.2d 277, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 194 (2000). Abduction not incidental to othe r crimes.  Defendants conviction for abduction was not incidental to animate object sexual penetration, § 18.2-67.2, and taking indecent liberties with a minor, § 18.2-370, and was a separate offense, as the victim testified that he grabbed her as she tried to leave the room and tricked her into leaving the bathroom and into entering his bedroom; neither of these acts was inherent in the commission of object sexua l penetration or taking indecent liberties with a minor. Dade v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 368 (Va. Ct. App. June 24, 2003). Defendants claim that he did not abduct a victim because the detention was incidental to the restraint employed in a rape was not preserved for appeal; the vi ctim testified that defendant grabbed her wrists and pulled her to a bedroom, and those actions were not inherent to the commission of rape or forcible sodomy, defendant failed to establish than an element of the offense did not occur. Payne v. Commonwea lth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 135 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 30, 2004).

Any person who knowingly, wrongfully and intentionally withholds a child from either of a childs parents or other legal guardian in a clear and significant violation of a court order respecting the custody or visitation of such child, provided such child is wit hheld outside of the Commonwealth, is guilty of a Class 6 felony. B. Any person who knowingly, wrongfully and intentionally engages in conduct that constitutes a clear and significant violation of a court order respecting the custody or visitation of a child is guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor upon conviction of a first offense. Any person who commits a second violation of this section within 12 months of a first conviction is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor, and any person who commits a third violation occurring within 24 months of the first conviction is guilty of a Class 1 misdem eanor.

Foster-Zahid v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 430, 477 S.E.2d 759, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 709 (1996), aff'd, 254 Va. 168, 489 S.E.2d 687, 1997 Va. LEXIS 102 (1997). Proper venue found.  Where the evidence established that the father was a resident of Fairfax County at the time of the abduction by out-of-state mother and that the child was to be r eturned to Fairfax County pursuant to a valid and enforceable custody order, the harm contemplated by this section was clearly established as occurring in this locus for venue purposes. Foster-Zahid v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 430, 477 S.E.2d 759, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 709 (1996), aff'd, 254 Va. 168, 489 S.E.2d 687, 1997 Va. LEXIS 102 (1997). Defendants failure to relinquish custody of her minor child to the father in Virginia Beach constituted an offense committed within that circuit under § 19 .2-244. Accordingly, venue was proper in that jurisdiction as that was the jurisdiction to which the defendant was ordered to relinquish temporary custody and from which the defendant withheld custody. Dunn v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 219 (Va. C t. App. Apr. 15, 2003). Mother was the custodial parent only for the time of her visitation.  Despite the fact that the defendant was the custodial parent at the time the defendant left the Commonwealth with her minor child, the defendant was the custodial parent or rightful custodian only for that period of visitation until the defendant was to return the child to the father. Accordingly, the defendant was properly charged and convicted of custodial interference under § 18.2-49.1 A. Dunn v. Commonweal th, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 219 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 15, 2003). Sufficiency of evidence.  Trial court properly convicted defendant of felony parental abduction after a bench trial because, despite defendants attempt to justify his actions, the evid ence was sufficient to prove that defendant wrongfully withheld his 15-year-old son from the mothers lawful custody in violation of a court order, he unilaterally chose to take the child out of state for 15 days, did not contact the mother, the schoo l, department of social services, or the police officer investigating the missing person report of his plan to take the child to Pennsylvania, and did not return the child until the mother obtained a court order mandating him to return the child. Boyd v. Commonwealth, 72 Va. App. 274, 844 S.E.2d 425, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 195 (2020). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Constitutionality.  Subsection A of § 18.2-49.1, criminalizing parental abduction, is unconstitutionally vague, as clear and significant terminology is not defined with su fficient particularity, and individuals are left to speculate as to the meaning of the statute; in addition, the statute fails to establish minimal guidelines for law enforcement.

The Superin tendent of the State Police or the chief law-enforcement officer or sheriff of any county, city or town may designate one or more law-enforcement officers with appropriate technical training or expertise as a hostage and barricade communications speciali st. B. Each teleph one company providing service to Virginia residents shall designate a department or one or more individuals to provide liaison with law-enforcement agencies for the purposes of this section and shall designate telephone numbers, not exceeding two, at whi ch such law-enforcement liaison department or individual can be contacted. C. The supervi sing law-enforcement officer, who has jurisdiction in any situation in which there is probable cause to believe that the criminal enterprise of hostage holding is occurring or that a person has barricaded himself within a structure and poses an immediate threat to the life, safety or property of himself or others, may order a telephone company, or a hostage and barricade communications specialist to interrupt, reroute, divert, or otherwise control any telephone communications service involved in the hos tage or barricade situation for the purpose of preventing telephone communication by a hostage holder or barricaded person with any person other than a law-enforcement officer or a person authorized by the officer. D. A hostage a nd barricade communication specialist shall be ordered to act under subsection C only if the telephone company providing service in the area has been contacted and requested to act under subsection C or an attempt to contact has been made, using the tele phone companys designated liaison telephone numbers and: 1. The o fficers attempt to contact after ten rings for each call is unsuccessful; 2. The telephone company declines to respond to the officers request because of a threat of personal injury to its employees; or 3. The telephone company indicates when contacted that it will be unable to respond appropriately to the officers request within a reasonable time from the receipt of the request. E. The supervi sing law-enforcement officer may give an order under subsection C only after that supervising law-enforcement officer has given or attempted to give written notification or oral notification of the hostage or barricade situation to the telephone company providing service to the area in which it is occurring. If an order is given on the basis of an oral notice, the oral notice shall be followed by a written confirmation of that notice within forty-eight hours of the order. F. Good faith reliance on an order by a supervising law-enforcement officer who has the real or apparent authority to issue an order under this section shall constitute a complete defense to any action against a telephone company or a telephone company employee that r ises out of attempts by the telephone company or the employees of the telephone company to comply with such an order.

C. Evidence. D. Instructions. E. Verdict, Sentence and Punishment. I.General Consideration. This section is commonly referred to as the maiming statute. Fletcher v. Commonwealth, 20 9 Va. 636, 166 S.E.2d 269, 1969 Va. LEXIS 154 (1969). Purpose of act.  The true purpose and meaning of the maiming act was doubtless conceived to be to define and punish as felonies those acts which had theretofore been considered mi sdemeanors only in those cases where it also appeared that there was the felonious intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill. Harris v. Commonwealth, 150 Va. 580, 142 S.E. 354, 1928 Va. LEXIS 337 (1928); Bryant v. Commonwealth, 189 Va. 310, 53 S.E.2d 5 4, 1949 Va. LEXIS 172 (1949). An assault is not punishable under this section. Jones v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 679, 36 S .E.2d 571, 1946 Va. LEXIS 133 (1946). Unlawful maiming, unlawful wounding, unlawful shooting and unlawful stabbing standing alone are not crimes embraced under this secti on. Banner v. Commonwealth, 204 Va. 640, 133 S.E.2d 305, 1963 Va. LEXIS 198 (1963). Bodily injury.  Concluding that the term bodily injury has one meaning in the context of § 18.2-51, but has another meaning within the context of § 18.2-51.6, when the two statutes are part of the same legislative scheme and the relevant language of the two statutes is identical, would be illogical. Accordingly, reading these statutes in pari materia, it is clear that the legislature intended the term bodily in jury to hold its everyday, ordinary meaning throughout the entire statutory scheme. Moore v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 162 (Va. Ct. App. May 6, 2014). Aggravated malicious wounding distinguished.  Unlike the crime of aggravated malicious wounding under § 18.2-51.2, which requires proof that the victim suffered a permanent and significant physical impairm ent as a result of the wound inflicted by the defendant, the crime of malicious wounding under § 18.2-51, does not require that the wound inflicted by the defendant be permanent or significant; the crime of malicious wounding lacks the severity and pe rmanence elements required for the offense of aggravated malicious wounding, and merely requires that the defendant intended to inflict a permanent wound. An Trong Tran v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 195 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 27, 2004). Compared to assault with a dangerous weapon under federal law.  Defendants sought dismissal of counts under 18 U.S.C.S. §§ 1959 and 924(c), of the indictment on the ground that the elements of Virginias malicious or unlawful wounding statute, § 18.2-51, and brandishing statute, § 18.2-282, the state laws that the charged assaults allegedly violated, did not match  element-by-element  with the elements of assault with a dangerous weapon under federal la w, but, the elements of malicious or unlawful wounding under Virginia law were adequately similar to those of assault with a dangerous weapon and aggravated assault as generically defined, the indictment charging assault with a dangerous weapon was suffi cient, and the motion to dismiss was denied. United States v. Cuong Gia Le, 316 F. Supp. 2d 355, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7786 (E.D. Va. 2004). Double jeopardy considerations.  Multiple punishments for the crimes of attempted murder and malicious wounding do not violate the double jeopardy clause when the convictions are obtained in a si ngle trial. Creamer v. Commonwealth, No. 1298-91-3 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 15, 1992). Crimes of attempted murder and malicious wounding had different elements, and therefore defendants convictions of both did not violate double jeopardy. Colema n v. Commonwealth, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 445 (Va. Ct. App. July 20, 1999), aff'd, 261 Va. 196, 539 S.E.2d 732, 2001 Va. LEXIS 12 (2001). Defendants convictions for malicious wounding and maiming by mob did not violate principles of double jeopardy as malicious wounding contained an additional e lement not found in maiming by mob, namely that the defendant acted with malice. Thus, it followed that one who was guilty of maiming by mob was not necessarily guilty of malicious wounding. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. App. 303, 709 S.E.2d 175, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 185 (2011). There were two distinct victims of the crimes of which defendant was convicted: the victim of the improper driving traffic offense was the Commonwealth, and the v ictim of the unlawful wounding was defendants ex-boyfriend. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to dismiss the unlawful wounding charge. Moore v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 122 (Va. Ct. App. May 1, 2018). Lesser included offe nse.  The shooting of another unlawfully but without malicious intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill, is a lesser included offense of malicious shooting and is al so a felony. Jones v. Blankenship, 458 F. Supp. 521, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15707 (W.D. Va. 1978). Assault and battery and unlawful wounding are lesser included offenses of malicious wounding. Brown v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 111, 279 S.E.2d 142, 1981 Va. LEXIS 2 81 (1981). Unlawful wounding is a lesser included offense of malicious wounding; the element of malice constitutes the distinction between malicious and unlawful wounding. M iller v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 22, 359 S.E.2d 841, 4 Va. Law Rep. 389, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 266 (1987). Malicious wounding is not a lesser included offense of robbery. Walker v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 203, 415 S.E.2d 446, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2486, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 105 (1992). Assault and battery is a lesser-included offense of malicious wounding. Vaughn v. Commonwealth, 34 Va. App. 263, 540 S.E.2d 516, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (2001), re v'd, 263 Va. 31, 557 S.E.2d 220, 2002 Va. LEXIS 7 (2002). The intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill is not necessarily included in the definition of murder or manslaughter and, therefore, malicious wounding is not a lesser-included offense embraced within the crime of murder or manslaughter. Hampton v. Commonwealth, 34 Va. App. 412, 542 S.E.2d 41, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 86 (2001). Preservation for rev iew.  Defendant argued specifically and extensively in his motion to strike that he had no intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill, and this was sufficient to prese rve the error that there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to convict him of unlawful wounding. Jones v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 101 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2015). Venue.  Although appellant moved to change venue because it was impossible to have a fair trial by an impartial jury, he did not timely obtain a ruling on the motion. Ram os v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. App. 150, 834 S.E.2d 499, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2019). II.Nature and Elements of Of fenses. A.In General. Attempted malicious wounding.  An attempt to commit the crime of malicious wounding consists of: (1) the specific intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill and (2) an ineffectual act done towa rds the crimes completion. Moody v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 702, 508 S.E.2d 354, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 659 (1998). In order to convict an accused of attempted malicious wounding, the Commonwealth must prove that the accused: (1) intended to maliciously shoot, stab, cut or woun d any person or by any means cause bodily injury with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill; and (2) committed a direct but ineffectual act toward this purpose. Smith v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 120 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 13, 2001); Knox v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (Va. Ct. App. May 1, 2001). Evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for attempted malicious wounding, although the circumstances were suspicious, because the evidence failed to est ablish an overt act necessary to prove an a...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-52"><akn:num>§ 18.2-52</akn:num><akn:heading>Malicious bodily injury by means of any caustic substance or agent or use of any explosive or fire</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If any person maliciously causes any other person bodily injury by means of any acid, lye or other caustic substance or agent or use of any explosive or fire, he shall be guilty of a felony and shall be punished by confinement in a state correctional facility for a period of not less than five years nor more than thirty years. If such act is done unlawfully but not maliciously, the offender shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. History History. Code 1950, § 18.1-67; 1960, c. 358; 1975, cc. 14, 15, 604; 199 5, c. 439.

CASE NOTES Caustic substance.  Spray that smelled like pepper, caused victims eyes and skin to burn, temporarily blinded her, and required medical attention was a caustic substance, even th ough the substance was not recovered, tested, or introduced into evidence. Floyd v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. App. 193, 522 S.E.2d 382, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 678 (1999). Classification of a substance as a caustic substance does not preclude a classification of the same substance as a noxious gas; a substance may have the c haracteristics of both a noxious gas and a caustic substance, and a noxious gas, for example, may cause bodily injury through its caustic, or burning, effects. Therefore, in a case where defendant either used mace or pepper spray, it was up to the prosec utor to determine what crime to charge her with. Somerville v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 45 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 10, 2015), aff'd, No. 150386, 2016 Va. Unpub. LEXIS 3 (Va. Feb. 12, 2016). Pepper spray.  Defendants conviction for being part of a mob that maliciously caused bodily injury by means of a caustic substance was affirmed, as the pepper spray used dur ing his gangs attack on a rival gang at a hotel was a caustic substance within the meaning of the term caustic substance or agent. Corado v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 315, 623 S.E.2d 452, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 528 (2005). Sufficient evidence.  Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the pepper spray used during the attack against a rival gang was a caustic substance, as testimony established that the pepper spray caused burning and significant irritation. Corado v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 315, 623 S.E.2d 452, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 528 (2005). Insufficient evidence.  Lower courts erred in finding defendant guilty of felony malicious bodily injury by means of a caustic substance, felony assault and battery of a law-enforcement officer, and obstruction of justice because the evidence contradicted the inference that defendant was hiding behind a water heater and released a bear deterrent while his brothers hands were raised, the evidence that defendant was present in the basement two hours later was equally as susceptible to a finding consistent with his innocence as it was to a finding of guilt, and the record did not demonstrate that defendant procured, encouraged, countenanced, approved commission of the crime, s hared the criminal intent of his brother, or was guilty of some overt act. Wright v. Commonwealth, 292 Va. 386, 789 S.E.2d 611, 2016 Va. LEXIS 109 (2016), cert. denied, 581 U.S. 908, 137 S. Ct. 1442, 197 L. Ed. 2d 655, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 2293 (2017). § 18.2-52.1. Possession of infectious biological substances or radiological agents; penalties. Text A. Any person who possesses, with the intent thereby to injure another, an infectious biological substance or radiological agent is guilty of a Class 5 felony. B. Any person who (i) destroys or damages, or attempts to destroy or damage, any facility, equipment or material involved in the sale, manufacturing, storage or distribution of an infectious biological substance or radiological agent, with the intent to injure another by releasing the substance, or (ii) manufactures, sells, gives, distributes or uses an infectious biological substance or radiological agent with the intent to injure another is guilty of a Class 4 felony. C. Any person who maliciously and intentionally causes any other person bodily injury by means of an infectious biological substance or radiological agent is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by confinement in a state correctional facility for a period of not l ess than five years nor more than 30 years. D. For purpose s of this section:An infectious biological substance includes any bacteria, viruses, fungi, proto zoa, or rickettsiae capable of causing death or serious bodily injury. Infectious biological substance does not include the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) or any other related virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), syp hilis, or hepatitis B.A radiological agent includes any substance able to release radiation at le vels that are capable of causing death or serious bodily injury.

Animal attack resulting from owners disregard for human life; penalty. Text A. Any owner o f an animal is guilty of a Class 6 felony if his willful act or omission in the care, control, or containment of such animal is so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life and is the proximate cause of such animal attack ing and causing serious bodily injury to any person.

CASE NOTES The purpose of this section is to deter the use of specific forms of violence and thus l essen the risk of bodily harm to the potential victims of felonious crime. To effectuate this purpose, the General Assembly employed the only appropriate means available, viz., the imposition of punishment for the use of such violence in addition to the penalty prescribed for the primary felony. Blythe v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 722, 284 S.E.2d 796, 1981 Va. LEXIS 366 (1981). Legislative intent regarding multiple punishments.  Defendants punishment for two counts of malicious wounding resulting from the stabbing of two victims and for two counts of stabbing/cutting the same victims during the commission of a felony does not offend the double jeopardy clause because the General Assembly intended to impose multiple punishments when enacting this section. Hall v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 892, 421 S.E.2d 455, 9 Va. Law Rep. 54, 1992 V a. App. LEXIS 210 (1992). Court rejected defendants contention that he was punished twice for the same offense as the Virginia General Assembly intended to impose multiple punishments when enacting § 18.2-53. Moreover, the statutes each contained an element that the other did not: aggravated malicious wounding required malice, an intent to maim, and resulting permanent physical injury, while unlawful stabbing required a wounding du ring the commission of an underlying felony. Franklin v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 356 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 6, 2012). The legislative intent to authorize cumulative punishment is clear in this section, desp ite the absence of an express statement to that effect. Blythe v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 722, 284 S.E.2d 796, 1981 Va. LEXIS 366 (1981). Section 19.2-294 does not prohibit defendants prosecution in a single trial for aggr avated malicious wounding and use of a firearm in the commission of the aggravated malicious wounding. Powell v. Commonwealth, No. 0554-89-1 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 6, 1992). Intent to wound does not preclude intent to steal.  The mere fact that appellant had the intent to commit malicious wounding did not exclude the hypothesis that he also formed the intent to steal victims proper ty. Saunders v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 825, 447 S.E.2d 526, 11 Va. Law Rep. 138, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 555 (1994). Evidence sufficient for conviction.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of both aggravated malicious wounding and stabbing in the commission of a felony because surveillance video showed wh at occurred; the video showed that immediately after defendant raised a knife to the victims neck, the victim fell to the ground, and defendant expressed remorse and stated that he should not have hurt the victim. Loyol v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (Va. Ct. App. July 26, 2022). Sentence upheld.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion following defendants guilty pleas to voluntary manslaughter, shooting in the commission of a felony, and two counts o f unlawfully discharging a firearm in an occupied building in imposing a fifteen-year sentence with five years suspended, which did not exceed the statutory maximum, because the proffer contained facts from which the court could have found that defendant exhibited both premeditation and malice in getting a gun and returning to twice shoot defendants spouse during a dispute in their home. Spradling v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 15, 2016). Remand.  Conviction and final sentencing orders erroneously reflected defendant was found guilty of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony in violation of the stat ute because the record reflected that defendant pleaded guilty to and was convicted of shooting in the commission of a felony in violation of the statute; accordingly, the case was remanded for the sole purpose of amending those orders to reflect that de fendant was found guilty of shooting in the commission of a felony. Md. v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. App. 483, 877 S.E.2d 537, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 440 (2022). § 18.2-53.1. Use or display of firearm in committing felony.

Underlying Offenses. B. Use of a Firearm. III. Evidentiary Matters. IV. Punishment. I.In General. Effect of 1976 amendment.  As a result of the 1976 amendment to this section, the use of a firearm while committing a felony no longer is sufficient to constitute a violation of the section. Now, a violation occurs only when a firearm is used with respect to the felonies specified in this section. Bundy v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 485, 259 S.E.2d 826, 1979 Va. LEXIS 287 (1979). Legislative intent.  General Assembly clearly indicated its intent to impose multiple punishments for capital murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony pursuant to thi s section. Wolfe v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 640, 371 S.E.2d 314, 5 Va. Law Rep. 105, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 77 (1988). The General Assembly, in adopting this section, intended to discourage the use of a firearm at any time during the course of the specified criminal endeavors. Cre asy v. Commonwealth, 9 Va. App. 470, 389 S.E.2d 316, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1378, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 33 (1990). The purpose of § 18.2-53.1 is not only to deter violent criminal conduct, but also to discourage criminal conduct that produces fear of physical harm to a vict im from an instrument that gives the appearance of having a firing capability. Wubneh v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 224, 656 S.E.2d 418, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 56 (2008), overruled in part, Startin v. Commonwealth, 56 Va. App. 26, 690 S.E.2d 310, 2010 Va. Ap p. LEXIS 115 (2010).

App. LEXIS 442 (1994). Bodily injury.  The burning of the eyes of a correctional officer which lasted for ten to fifteen minutes, requiring medical treatment, caused by prisoner who threw urine at the officer constituted bodily injury under the provisions of this section. Karnes v. Commonwealth, No. 0982-88-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 19, 1989). Instruction on les ser included offense required.  The jury could have found that while the defendant might not have had the specific intent to knowingly and willfully inflict bodily injury under this sect ion, he was nonetheless guilty of the lesser included offense of misdemeanor assault and battery, and the jury should have been instructed on the lesser included offense. Kelly v. Commonwealth, No. 0495-96-4 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 4, 1997). Relationship to other laws.  Where a defendant appealed his 15-year sentence for violating 18 U.S.C.S. § 922(g)(1), he was properly sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) as his three prior convictions under § 18.2-55 were violent felonies as they had, as an element, the use of physical force against the person of another, and the ACCAs phrase use of physical force included force applied directly or indirectly.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Civil remedy.  This section created a civil remedy for persons receiving bodily injury by hazing whether or not they were criminally charged and convicted, and that the student had sufficiently alleged that he was subject to conduct by the fraternity members that could reasonably constitute hazing, including the over consumption of alcohol and a severe burn to the students left buttock. Liberati v. Andress, 2021 Va. Cir. LE XIS 120 (Radford Apr. 23, 2021). Student sufficiently alleged that the fraternity members could be held liable for negligence per se under this section because the statute appeared to be intended for public safety, the student fell within the class of persons the statute was designed to protect, and he alleged that his bodily injury was a result of excessive consumption of alcohol.

Illustrative Cases. A. In General. B. Sufficiency of Evidence. I.General Consideration. This section fixes the punishment for, but does not define, the crime of robbery; conseq uently, the Supreme Court looks to the common law for its definition. Pierce v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 528, 138 S.E.2d 28, 1964 Va. LEXIS 213 (1964); Pettus v. Peyton, 207 Va. 906, 153 S.E.2d 278, 1967 Va. LEXIS 154 (1967); Durham v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 166, 198 S.E.2d 603, 1973 Va. LEXIS 276 (1973). The crime of robbery in Virginia is not defined by statute. This section fixes the punishments for robbery, but the definition of the crime is found in the common law. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 291, 163 S.E.2d 570, 1968 Va. LEXIS 229 (1968). Robbery is a common-law crime in Virginia, although its punishment is prescribed by this section. Pritchard v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 559, 303 S.E.2d 911, 1983 Va. LEXIS 256 (1983). Although the punishment for robbery is fixed by statute, the offense is not statutorily defined, and the court must look to the common law for its definition. Rob bery at common law is defined as the taking, with intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will, by violence or intimidation. George v. Commonwealth, 242 Va. 264, 411 S.E.2d 12, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1180, 1991 Va. LEXIS 156 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 973, 112 S. Ct. 1591, 118 L. Ed. 2d 308, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 2181 (1992). Grand larceny not lesser included offense of robbery.  Trial court erred in reducing the robbery charge in the indictment against defendant to grand larceny because grand larceny was not a lesser included offense of r obbery, as all the elements of grand larceny were not included in robbery. However, petit larceny was a lesser-included offense of robbery because all of the elements of petit larceny were contained in robbery. Dufresne v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEX IS 38 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 9, 2016), different results reached on reh'g, 66 Va. App. 644, 791 S.E.2d 335, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 267 (2016). When a statute prescribes a maximum imprisonment penalty and the sentence does not excee d that maximum, the sentence will not be overturned as being an abuse of discretion. West v. Commonwealth, No. 1146-91-1 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 19, 1993). Unit of prosecution for double jeopardy purposes.  Because the essential character of both this section and common-law robbery is violence against a person for the purpose of theft, the appropriate unit of pro secution for double jeopardy purposes is determined by the number of persons from whose possession property is taken separately by force or intimidation. Jordan v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 590, 347 S.E.2d 152, 3 Va. Law Rep. 132, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 310 (1986). Convictions under this section and § 18.2-93 not double jeopardy.  Convictions for both robbery and entry of a banking house with the intent to commit larceny while armed with a deadly weapon did not violate the double jeopardy c lause. Hill v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 683, 347 S.E.2d 913, 3 Va. Law Rep. 251, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 321 (1986). Multiple punishments did not violate double jeopardy clause.  The convictions and imposition of multiple punishments for capital murder, robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony did not violate appellant s rights under the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. Since those convictions and punishments did not violate the double jeopardy clause, his counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the issue. Peterson v. Bass, 2 Va. App. 314, 34 3 S.E.2d 475, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 274, aff'd, 349 S.E.2d 409, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1103 (Va. Ct. App. 1986). Armed robbery trial not barred by first degree murder conviction.  See Harrison v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 188, 257 S.E.2d 777, 1979 Va. LEXIS 253 (1979). Conviction for both robbery and carjacking allowed.  The Commonwealth is clearly permitted to try and convict an offender of both robbery and carjacking when the evidence supports convictions for those crimes. Brown v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 507, 559 S.E.2d 415, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 88 (2002). Robbery is not an incidental, probable consequence of an assault.  Robbery pursuant to § 18.2-58 is not an incidental, probable consequence of an assault; robbery requires a completely different type of wrongdoing: stealing. M cMorris v. Commonwealth, 276 Va. 500, 666 S.E.2d 348, 2008 Va. LEXIS 91 (2008). Double jeopardy.  Court of Appeals erred in reversing defendants conviction of grand larceny of a person, in violation of § 18.2-95, due to defendants earlier acquittal of robbery, charged pursuant to this section, as proof of violence or intimidation was required in a robbery prosecution, but not for grand larceny from the person, and proof of the value of the property stolen was required in a prosecution for grand lar ceny from the person, but not for robbery; hence, double jeopardy did not bar prosecution on the grand larceny charge upon a robbery acquittal. Commonwealth v. Hudgins, 269 Va. 602, 611 S.E.2d 362, 2005 Va. LEXIS 37 (2005), . Where defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery, § 18.2-22, defendants subsequent indictment for robbery, in violation of § 18.2-58, did n ot violate double jeopardy because each statute required proof of an element that the other did not. Williams v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 382 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 28, 2010). Where defendant pled guilty to an amended indictment for conspiracy to commit robbery, § 18.2-22, and the amendment occurred because defendant entered the ple a, defendants subsequent indictment for robbery did not violate double jeopardy. Williams v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 382 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 28, 2010). Plea agreement.  Although defendant was originally indicted for robbery in violation of § 18.2-58, and defendant pled guilty to an amended indictment for conspiracy to commit robbery, § 18.2-22, the Commonwealth was free to seek a new indictment for robbery when defendant failed to comply with a condition of the plea agreement that defendant would cooperate fully in the prosecution of a codefendant. Williams v. Commonwea lth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 382 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 28, 2010). Common-law i ndictment is good.  A robbery under this section differs in no res...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-59"><akn:num>§ 18.2-59</akn:num><akn:heading>Extortion of money, property or pecuniary benefit</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Any person who (i) threatens injury to the character, person, or property of another person, (ii) accuses him of any offense, (iii) threatens to report him as being ill egally present in the United States, or (iv) knowingly destroys, conceals, removes, confiscates, withholds or threatens to withhold, or possesses any actual or purported passport or other immigration document, or any other actual or purported government identification document, of another person, and thereby extorts money, property, or pecuniary benefit or any note, bond, or other evidence of debt from him or any other person, is guilty of a Class 5 felony. For the purposes of this section, injury to property includes the sale, distribution, or release of identifying information defined in clauses (iii) through (xii) of su bsection C of § 18.2-186.3, but does not include the distribution or release of such information by a person who does so with the intent to obtain money, property or a pecuniary benefit to which he reasonably believes he is lawfully entitled.

The 2007 amendment by c. 453 rewrote this section, which read: If any person threaten injury to the character, person, or property of another person or accuse him of any offense or threaten to report him as being illegally present in the United States and thereby extort money, property, or pecuniary benefit or any note, bond, or other evidence of debt from him or any other person, he shall be guilty of a Clas s 5 felony. The 2007 amendment by c. 547 added the A designation at the beginning of the first paragraph, and in subsection A, substituted Any person who threatens fo r If any person threaten, accuses for accuse, threatens for threaten, extorts for extort and is guilty for he shall be guilty; and added subsection B.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  This section is not vague and is facially constitutional; the words threat, character, and pecuniary benefit are all ordinary, everyday wo rds whose meanings are plain to a person of normal intelligence and education; furthermore, the trial court defined pecuniary benefit in a jury instruction as benefits that can be valued in money, and this definition was accepted by the d efendant without objection; finally the concept and proscription of extortion have long existed in the law of this Commonwealth. Stein v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 65, 402 S.E.2d 238, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1880, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 37 (1991). This section is constitutional in that it is not overbroad and does not impinge upon the First Amendment right to free speech. Stein v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 65, 402 S.E.2d 238, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1880, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 37 (1991). Rule of absolu te privilege in judicial proceedings.  Defendant, a real estate subdivision developer, was entitled to strike an attempted extortion indictment because defendants written notice to a property owner of intent to file a lien was made in the context of a judicial proceeding. The relevant and material statements in the notice were thereby covered by absolute privilege and were not a wrongful threat in the context of an extortion charge. Ware v. Common wealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 212 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 1, 2019). The threat to do a legal act is not per se protected speech. Morrissey v. Commonwealth, 1 6 Va. App. 172, 428 S.E.2d 503, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1120, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 78 (1993). Guilt or innocence of victim of extortion is irrelevant.  Questions propounded by the counsel of the accused concerning the guilt or innocence of the victim of the extortion, were irrelevant, immaterial and properly excl uded. Whether persons upon whom extortion is practiced are vicious or virtuous they are equally entitled to the protection of the law. Mitchell v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. 856, 1880 Va. LEXIS 16 (1880). Claim of right is not considered a defense to extortion under Virginia law. United State s v. Teplin, 775 F.2d 1261, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 24413 (4th Cir. 1985). Claim of right no defense to extortion .  Appellants alleged claim of right to the money he sought to obtain by extortion from the victim provided no defense. Strohecker v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 2 42, 475 S.E.2d 844, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 619 (1996). The absence of any claim of right defense demonstrates that, under the Virginia extortion statute, the lawfulness of the demanded object is irrelevant; th erefore, an extortionate means is sufficient to establish liability under § 18.2-59. Smithfield Foods, Inc. v. United Food &amp; Commer. Workers Int'l Union, 585 F. Supp. 2d 789, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81889 (E.D. Va. 2008). Public disclosure or even proposed public disclosure is not extortion unless coupled wit h an effort to obtain money or other value from the victim. Wood v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 560, 382 S.E.2d 306, 6 Va. Law Rep. 135, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 103 (1989). Constructive breaking.  Where entry is gained by threats, fraud or conspiracy, a constructive breaking is deemed to have occurred; thus, breaking may be actual or constructive. Broady v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 281, 429 S.E.2d 468, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1294, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 98 (1993). Money demanded to remain silent about invalid revocation of prenuptial agreement.  Defendant had no claim of right to the money he demanded, where he was clearly demanding hush money to remain silent about the alleged invalidity of a rev ocation agreement nullifying a prenuptial agreement between defendants former legal client and her husband. The revocation agreement allowed the wife to claim her statutory share of her husbands estate. United States v. Teplin, 775 F.2d 1261, 198 5 U.S. App. LEXIS 24413 (4th Cir. 1985). Commonwealth did not need to prove that accusation underlying threat was false.  Where defendant had accused victim of raping her and where the Commonwealth elected to charge defendant with threatening to injure victims character, it was n ot necessary for the Commonwealth to prove that an accusation underlying the threat was false, even though the threatened injury was to the character of a person and did not constitute an accusation of an offense. Wood v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 560, 38 2 S.E.2d 306, 6 Va. Law Rep. 135, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 103 (1989). Extortion held alleged.  Where it was alleged that: (a) defendants entered into a contract with plaintiff, knowing at the time that they did not intend to perform and knowing also that pl aintiff would rely on their contract to expose itself to economic risk; (b) plaintiff in reliance on the contract with defendant entered into a commercial arrangement with another; and (c) defendants exacted moneys, property and pecuniary benefits on the threat of causing plaintiff the economic harm which would stem from nonperformance of its other commercial arrangement, extortion was alleged. Battlefield Bldrs., Inc. v. Swango, 743 F.2d 1060, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 18399 (4th Cir. 1984). Evidence sufficient.  Trial court did not err in finding defendant guilty, following a bench trial, of computer fraud, computer trespass, embezzlement, and attempted extortion, as the evidence showed that defendant transferred computer files from his computer at work to a third-party server before he was terminated from his position as human resource director, that he used the removed material to threaten the company in an attempt to forgive a loan it had made to him, and that the company established the value of the material removed as required to support convictions on those offenses.

Evidence insufficient.  Evidence was insufficient to sustain defendants extortion conviction because the victim testified that he intended to pay defendant the agreed sum of money fo r her services when he went to her apartment and had the cash in an envelope with her name on it in his wallet; defendant did not threaten the victim or accuse him of any crime before she took the envelope containing the money from the victims wallet ; and she told him that he was under arrest for solicitation and that she would ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-60"><akn:num>§ 18.2-60</akn:num><akn:heading>18</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>2-60.

CASE NOTES Malice not element of offense.  In a prosecution under this section, a trial court is not required to instruct the jury on malice, as malice is not an element of the offense. Saunders v. Commonw ealth, 31 Va. App. 321, 523 S.E.2d 509, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 15 (2000). What constitutes threats.  Defendants posts on his MySpace profile constituted threats under subdivision A 1 of § 18.2-60 as the graphic and violent imagery used in the messages spec ifically referred to the victim and her family, referring to the victim by using her maiden name, referencing specific incidents involving the victim, and identifying details that were unique to the acrimonious history between defendant and the victim. D efendant frequently stated in his messages that he just had to stab the victim and slit her neck into a fountain drink. Holcomb v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. App. 339, 709 S.E.2d 711, 2011 Va.

If any pers on has sexual intercourse with a complaining witness, whether or not his or her spouse, or causes a complaining witness, whether or not his or her spouse, to engage in sexual intercourse with any other person and such act is accomplished (i) against the complaining witnesss will, by force, threat or intimidation of or against the complaining witness or another person; or (ii) through the use of the complaining witnesss mental incapacity or physical helplessness; or (iii) with a child under age 1 3 as the victim, he or she shall be guilty of rape. B. A violation of this section shall be punishable, in the discretion of the court or jury, by confinement in a state correctional facility for life or for any term not less than five years; and in addition: 1. For a violation of clause (iii) of subsection A where the offender is more than three years older than the victim, if done in the commission of, or as part of the same course of conduct as, or as part of a common scheme or plan as a violation of (i) subsectio n A of § 18.2-47 or § 18.2-48, (ii) § 18.2-89, 18.2-90, or 18.2-91, or (iii) § 18.2-51.2, the punishment shall include a mandatory minimum term of confinement of 25 years; or 2. For a violation of clause (iii) of subsection A where it is alleged in the indictment that the offender was 18 years of age or older at the time of the offense, the punishment shall in clude a mandatory minimum term of confinement for life.The mandatory minimum terms of confinement prescribed for violations of this section shall be served consecutively with any other sentence. If the term of confinement imposed for any violation of clause (iii) of subsection A, where the offender is more than three years older than the victim, is for a term less than life imprisonment, the judge shall impose, in addition to any active sentence, a suspended sentence of no less than 40 years. This suspended sentence shall be suspended for the remainder of the defendants life, subject to revocation by the court.There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a juvenile over the age of 10 but less than 12, does not possess the physical capacity to commit a violation of this section. In any case deemed appropriate by the court, all or part of any sentence imposed for a violation under this section against a spouse may be suspende d upon the defendants completion of counseling or therapy, if not already provided, in the manner prescribed under § 19.2-218.1 if, after consideration of the views of the complaining witness and such other evidence as may be relevant, the court f inds such action will promote maintenance of the family unit and will be in the best interest of the complaining witness. C. Upon a find ing of guilt under this section, when a spouse is the complaining witness in any case tried by the court without a jury, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt, upon motion of the defendant who has not previously had a proceeding against him for violation of this section dismissed pursuant to this subsection and with the consent of the complaining witness and the attorney for the Commonwealth, may defer further proceedings and place the defendant on probation pending completion of counseling or therapy, if not already provided, in the manner prescribed under § 19.2-218.1. If the defendant fails to so complete such counseling or therapy, the court may make final disposition of the case and proceed as otherwise provided. If such counseling is completed as prescribed under § 19.2-218.1, the court may discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings against him if, after consideration of the views of the complaining witness and such other evidence as may be relevant, the court finds such action will promote maintenance of the family unit and be in the best interest of the complaining witness.

Rape and Other Statutory Offenses, §§ 3, 5, 27 . CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Imposing a more restrictive sex-offender classification for indecent liberties with a child than for carnal knowledge of a child did not violate equal protection because carnal knowledge can involve juvenile offenders, while indecent liberties is a crime committed only by adults, and the distinction is rationally related to the states legitimate interest in affording juveniles more leniency. A cruel-and-unusu al punishment claim also failed because sex-offender registration is not a punishment. Doe v. Settle, 24 F.4th 932, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2691 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 2874, 213 L. Ed. 2d 1093, 2022 U.S. LEXIS 3159 (2022). Not a lesser-included offense of rape.  The offense of carnally knowing a child under 14 years of age without the use of force is not a lesser-included offense of rape, and the Commonwealth did not viol ate defendants right against double jeopardy under the federal or state Constitutions by seeking an indictment for carnally knowing a child after a rape charge against defendant was dismissed.

When force essential element.  In prosecution under this section verdict finding defendant guilty of having carnal knowledge of prosecutrix without force was properly amended to show that prose cutrix was under the age of 16 (now 15) where evidence unquestionably showed that she was under 16. The original verdict was ambiguous according to the definition of rape under this section, because if the female be 16 (now 15) or more force must be used but if she be under that age force is not an essential ingredient. Carpenter v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 851, 71 S.E.2d 377, 1952 Va. LEXIS 196 (1952). Knowledge of victims age not essential to constitute attempt to commit statutory rape. Rainey v. Commonwealth, 169 Va. 892, 193 S.E. 501, 1937 Va. LEXIS 197 (1937). Failure to allege exact age of prosecutrix.  In a prosecution for statutory rape where the indictment alleged that the prosecutrix was under the age of 15, it was held that the defendant was not in any way p rejudiced by the failure to allege the exact age of the prosecutrix. Stump v. Commonwealth, 137 Va. 804, 119 S.E. 72, 1923 Va. LEXIS 204 (1923). When consent immaterial, evidence of subsequent intercourse is admissible.  The authorities are in conflict upon the general question as to whether, in a prosecution for statutory rape, evidence may be admitted of intercourse between the accused and the prosecutrix subsequent to the act upon which the prosecution is based. The better doctrine is that where the consent of the prosecutrix is immaterial, such evidence is admissible as tending to show the disposition of the defendant with re spect to the particular act charged. Stump v. Commonwealth, 137 Va. 804, 119 S.E. 72, 1923 Va. LEXIS 204 (1923). And consent of infant is no defense to attempt charge.  Since a 14-year-old girls consent would have been no defense to a charge of statutory rape if the sexual act had taken place, it was no defense to an attempt to commit the crime of statutory rape. Rainey v. Commonwealth, 169 Va. 892, 193 S.E. 501, 1937 Va. LEXIS 197 (1937). Failure to make outcry held not to make prosecutrixs testimony incredible.  In a prosecution under this section the accused having been indicted for statutory rape and the testimony having conclusively shown that the prosecutrix was 14 ye ars of age and that intercourse had been had with her, she having given birth to a child, the fact that she failed to make any outcry was not sufficient to warrant the Supreme Court in holding that her testimony was so incredible that it could not be bel ieved. Salyer v. Commonwealth, 163 Va. 1027, 175 S.E. 757, 1934 Va. LEXIS 223 (1934). As a general rule, time is not a material ingredient of the offense of rape, and it need not be proved precisely as alleged, it being sufficient in prosecutions for the offense on females under the age of consent to prove the commission of the offense on any day when the female was still under the statutory age. Lear v. Commonwealth, 195 Va . 187, 77 S.E.2d 424, 1953 Va. LEXIS 189 (1953). Chastity of a female is not made an ingredient of the offense of statutory rape. Carpente r v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 851, 71 S.E.2d 377, 1952 Va. LEXIS 196 (1952). Evidence of prior sexual act admis sible.  Evidence of prior sexual act with child rape victim was admissible and relevant for the limited purposes of showing defendants inclination to commit the acts with which defendant was charged and as tending to corroborate the testimony of the alleged victim. Mangum v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 4, 2003). Defendants age established.  Even if defendants appearance did not establish that defendant was well over 18 at the time of a § 18.2-63 incident, defendants appearance, combined wi th defendants statements that defendant had graduated from high school, that defendant was celebrating a birthday, and that defendant was one of the people over 21 who had been drinking established that defendant was over 18 at the time of the incide nt. Hall v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 73 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 17, 2009). Evidence held sufficient.  Where evidence showed that defendants mouth came in contact with the minors penis, trial courts conclusion that the defendant had carnal knowledge of the minor by the mouth in violation of this section was not plainly wrong. Shull v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 667, 431 S.E.2d 924, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1622, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 217 (1993), aff'd, 247 Va. 161, 440 S.E.2d 133, 10 Va. Law Rep. 807, 1994 Va. LEXI S 24 (1994). Testimony by the victim that she was 14 years old and that she had sexual relations with defendant over 20 times and testimony of the victims mother that she suspected that defendant and the victim were having sexual relations, and that defendant confirmed that her suspicions were true, provided sufficient evidence to support defendants conviction for having carnal knowledge of child between 13 and 15, in violation of § 18.2-63. Welch v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 253 (Va. Ct. App. June 28, 2005), rev'd, 271 Va. 558, 628 S.E.2d 340, 2006 Va. LEXIS 50 (2006). Defendant asserted that, in granting his motion to strike on the ground that the Commonwealths evidence was insufficient to prove the charge of animate object sexual penetration under § 18.2-67.2, the trial court effectively acquitted him of that charge and dismissed the indictment, but the trial court concluded that, although the Commonwealths evidence was insufficient to prove the element of force, t hreat, intimidation, or physical helplessness, the evidence was sufficient, as a matter of law, to sustain a conviction for carnal knowledge under this section; thus, the trial courts granting of the motion to strike did not constitute a judgment of acquittal under Va.

Attempted aggravated sexual battery.  General assembly passed a law, § 18.2-67.5, stating the punishment for attempted sexual assault offenses, including attempted aggravated sexual battery, and pa ssed § 18.2-67, permitting the deposition of a complaining witness in cases of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault, and, if it had intended to exclude attempt crimes from § 18.2-67.3, it would not have passed a law permitting a depo sition of a complaining witness in attempted aggravated sexual battery and would not have passed a law stating the punishment for attempted aggravated sexual battery, so there was no evidence the general assembly intended to abrogate common-law a ttempt when it passed § 18.2-67.3, and the crime of attempted aggravated sexual battery existed in Virginia.

If the term of confinement imposed for any violation of subdivision A 1, where the offender is more than three years older than the victim, is for a term less than life imprisonment, the judge shall impose, in addition to any active sentence, a suspen ded sentence of no less than 40 years. This suspended sentence shall be suspended for the remainder of the defendants life, subject to revocation by the court.In any case deemed appropriate by the court, all or part of any sentence imposed for a viol ation under this section against a spouse may be suspended upon the defendants completion of counseling or therapy, if not already provided, in the manner prescribed under § 19.2-218.1 if, after consideration of the views of the complaining witnes s and such other evidence as may be relevant, the court finds such action will promote maintenance of the family unit and will be in the best interest of the complaining witness. C. Upon a find ing of guilt under this section, when a spouse is the complaining witness in any case tried by the court without a jury, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt, upon motion of the defendant who has not previously had a proceeding against him for violation of this section dismissed pursuant to this subsection and with the consent of the complaining witness and the attorney for the Commonwealth, may defer further proceedings and place the defendant on probation pending completion of counseling or therapy, if not already provided, in the manner prescribed under § 19.2-218.1. If the defendant fails to so complete such counseling or therapy, the court may make final disposition of the case and proceed as otherwise provided. If such counseling is completed as prescribed under § 19.2-218.1, the court may discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings against him if, after consideration of the views of the complaining witness and such other evidence as may be relevant, the court finds such action will promote maintenance of the family unit and be in the best interest of the complaining witness.

CASE NOTES United S tates Supreme Court ruling regarding abortion.  A state criminal abortion statute that excepts from criminality only a life saving procedure on behalf of the mother without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medi cal judgment of the pregnant womans attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the state, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedu re in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For the stage subsequent to viability the state, in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life, may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is nec essary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 159 (1973), overruled in part, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S . Ct. 2791, 120 L.

Reproductive Health Servs., 492 U.S. 490, 109 S. Ct. 3040, 1 06 L. Ed. 2d 410, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 3290 (1989) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 4751, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992)). Constitutionality.  While it is true that a statute which imposes a duty upon a physician to take affirmative action to preserve a fetus, irrespective of the stage of pregnancy and t he viability of the fetus, is constitutionally impermissible, after viability the sovereign has a compelling interest sufficient to justify regulation reasonably designed to preserve the life of the fetus. The proscription in this section against destruc tion of the fetus is not a command to preserve it; and, while subsection c of § 18.2-74 requires a physician to utilize fetal life support measures during the third trimester if there is any clearly visible evidence of viability, nothing in this artic le imposes such an affirmative duty during the pre-viable stages of pregnancy. Simopoulos v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 1059, 277 S.E.2d 194, 1981 Va. LEXIS 250 (1981), aff'd, 462 U.S. 506, 103 S. Ct. 2532, 76 L. Ed. 2d 755, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 65 (1983), disappr oved, City of Akron v.

Section 54.1-2917 was clearly enacted in aid of and for the purpose of facilitating the standards established in the state abortion statute, § 18.2-71, et seq. Simopoulos v. Virginia State Bd. of Medicine, 644 F.2d 321, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 19073 (4th Cir. 1981). Abortion and miscarriage synonymous.  Abortion is defined as the expulsion of the fetus at so early a period of uterogestation that it has not acquired the power of sustaining an independent life.  Although there may be a technical distinction recognized in medicine between abortion and miscarriage, the words are usually synonymous in law. Coffman v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 553, 50 S.E.2d 431, 1948 Va. LEXIS 189 (1948); Anderson v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 665, 58 S.E.2d 72, 1950 Va. LEXIS 159 (1950). Section was passed t o protect child, and society.  This section was passed, not for the protection of the pregnant woman, but for the protection of the unborn child and through it society. Miller v. Bennett, 190 V a. 162, 56 S.E.2d 217, 1949 Va. LEXIS 271 (1949). The crime denounced is not limited to abortion in its narrow meaning of expulsion of the fetus, but includes, as it plainly declares, the use of any means with intent to destroy an unborn child, resulting in the destruction of such child. Coffman v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 553, 50 S.E.2d 431, 1948 Va. LEXIS 189 (1948); Simopoulos v. Commonwea lth, 221 Va. 1059, 277 S.E.2d 194, 1981 Va. LEXIS 250 (1981), aff'd, 462 U.S. 506, 103 S. Ct. 2532, 76 L. Ed. 2d 755, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 65 (1983), disapproved, City of Akron v. Akron Ctr. for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416, 103 S. Ct. 2481, 76 L. Ed. 2d 687, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 63 (1983). The intent with which the means are used is the controlling factor. It seems clear from the language of this section that more than one intended consequence is included. If only the intent to cause an abortion, in the sense of expulsion of the fetus, and the causing of such abortion, were meant to be covered, the words intent to destroy her unborn child, and thereby destroy such child would be useless. It is not to be presumed that those words were used for no purpose and mean nothing in the statute. Anderson v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 665, 58 S.E.2d 72, 1950 Va. LEXIS 159 (1 950). Fetus need not be living at time of act.  This section is in two parts. The first part deals with the destruction of an unborn child by administering to the woman any drug or other thing, or using any mea ns with intent so to do. The second portion of the statute deals with performing these same acts with intent to produce and producing an abortion or miscarriage. Nowhere in the section is there any requirement that the fetus be living at the time of the act in order to constitute a violation, but under the first portion the life of the fetus at the time of the act is presupposed from the words destroy her unborn child. Anderson v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 665, 58 S.E.2d 72, 1950 Va. LEXIS 159 (1950 ). If the means used with the intent to destroy an unborn child result in the death of the mother and thereby the destruction of the child, the death of the mother is an agency set in motion by the means used to destroy the child. If the destruction of the child  the intended result  was accomplished by the means used, the perpe trator is guilty, under this section, of using means with intent to destroy the child, and thereby destroying the child, even though the death of the mother was not intended. Coffman v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 553, 50 S.E.2d 431, 1948 Va. LEXIS 189 (1948). Medical necessity exce ption matter of defense.  Where defendants indictment for violation of abortion statutes did not attempt to negate the exception of a medical necessity to treat the patient, the except ion was a matter of defense for the defendant to assert and not for the indictment to deny since the exception was made in a substantive section subsequent to the enacting section of the abortion statutes. Simopoulos v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 1059, 277 S. E.2d 194, 1981 Va. LEXIS 250 (1981), aff'd, 462 U.S. 506, 103 S. Ct. 2532, 76 L. Ed. 2d 755, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 65 (1983), disapproved, City of Akron v. Akron Ctr. for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416, 103 S. Ct. 2481, 76 L. Ed. 2d 687, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 63 (1983). Unnecessary to charge intent that fetus be expelled outside hospital.  Where defendant was convicted under an indictment charging that he employed procedures intended to initiate abortion during the second trimester of pregnancy and that he did so outside of a hospital licensed by the state, it was unnecessary to charge that he intended his patient to expel the fetus outside a hospital, since the proviso in § 18.2-73 applies to all procedures performed during the entire process, and since the definition of abortion is not limited to expulsion of the fetus. Simopoulos v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 1059, 277 S.E.2d 194, 1981 Va. LEXIS 250 (1981), aff'd, 462 U.S. 506, 103 S. Ct. 2532, 76 L. Ed. 2d 755, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 65 (1983), disapproved, City of Akron v.

Option with respect to allegation of causation.  The Commonwealth had the option of alleging and proving that a saline injection administered by the defendant caused either the death of the fetus or the expulsio n of the fetus in a prosecution for violation of the abortion statutes, since the crime is not limited to a narrow meaning of expulsion of the fetus. Simopoulos v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 1059, 277 S.E.2d 194, 1981 Va. LEXIS 250 (1981), aff'd, 462 U.S. 506 , 103 S. Ct. 2532, 76 L. Ed. 2d 755, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 65 (1983), disapproved, City of Akron v.

Sufficiency of evidence to p rove causation.  Absent evidence of any other causative factor, evidence that the defendant acknowledged administering a saline solution with intent to terminate pregnancy and tha t he realized that the procedure would destroy the fetus, testimony by the patient that the defendant told her the fetus was destroyed, and testimony by the medical examiner that the fetus was born dead, was sufficient to show that the saline solution de stroyed the fetus.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  The hospital requirement contained in the proviso in this section is constitutionally permissible, since it is reasonably related to the states compelling int erest in preserving and protecting maternal health, and since it does not unreasonably limit a pregnant womans access to medical care and thereby abridge her right to elect to abort. Simopoulos v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 1059, 277 S.E.2d 194, 1981 Va. LEXIS 250 (1981), aff'd, 462 U.S. 506, 103 S. Ct. 2532, 76 L. Ed. 2d 755, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 65 (1983), disapproved, City of Akron v.

Virginias requirement that second-trimester abortions be performed in licensed clinics is not an unreasonable means of furthering the states compelling in terest in protecting the womans own health and safety. The state has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient. Simopoulos v. Vir ginia, 462 U.S. 506, 103 S. Ct. 2532, 76 L. Ed. 2d 755, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 65 (1983). Section consistent with normal medical practice.  This section does not require that the patient be hospitalized as an inpatient or that the abortion be performed in a full-service, acute-care hospital. Rather, t he states requirement that second-trimester abortions be performed in licensed clinics appears to comport with accepted medical practice, and leaves the method and timing of the abortion precisely where they belong  with the physician and the pat ient. Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U.S. 506, 103 S. Ct. 2532, 76 L. Ed. 2d 755, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 65 (1983). The hospital proviso applies to all procedures performed during the entire abortion proc ess, including the means employed with intent to initiate the process. Simopoulos v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 1059, 277 S.E.2d 194, 1981 Va. LEXIS 250 (1981), aff'd, 462 U.S. 506, 103 S. Ct. 2532, 76 L. Ed. 2d 755, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 65 (1983), disapproved, Ci ty of Akron v.

The secti on has since been limited to prohibit advertisement in Virginia of practices prohibited by state law. Unconstitutional application.  Virginia could not apply this section as it read in 1971, to appellants publication of an advertisement without unconstitutionally infringing upon his First A mendment rights. Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 95 S. Ct. 2222, 44 L. Ed. 2d 600, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 73 (1975). Formerly aimed at out-of-state servi ces.  As applied, this section as it stood before the 1972 amendment was directed at the publishing of informative material relating to services offered in another stat e and was not directed at advertising by a referral agency or a practitioner whose activity Virginia had authority or power to regulate as the section now does. Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 95 S. Ct. 2222, 44 L. Ed. 2d 600, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 73 (1975 ). State police power does not extend to legal activities in other states.  A state does not acquire power or supervision over the internal affairs of another state merely because the welfare and health of its own citizens may be affected when they travel to that state. It may seek to disseminate information so as to enable its citizens to make better informed decisions when they leave. But it may not, under the guise of exercising internal police powers, bar a citizen of another state f rom disseminating information about an activity that is legal in that state. Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 95 S. Ct. 2222, 44 L. Ed. 2d 600, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 73 (1975). Sections overbreadth moot.  In view of this sections amendment since appellants conviction in such a way as effectively to repeal its prior application, there is no possibili ty now that the statutes pre-1972 form will be applied again to appellant or will chill the rights of others. As a practical matter, the issue of its overbreadth has become moot for the future. Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 95 S. Ct. 2222, 44 L. Ed. 2d 600, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 73 (1975). Advertising, like all public expression, may be subject to reasonable regulation that se rves a legitimate public interest. Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 95 S. Ct. 2222, 44 L. Ed. 2d 600, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 73 (1975). But is subject to First Am endment protection.  The fact that a particular advertisement in appellants newspaper had commercial aspects or reflected the advertisers commercial interests did not negate a ll First Amendment guarantees. The state was not free of constitutional restraint merely because the advertisement involved sales or solicitations. Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 95 S. Ct. 2222, 44 L.

CASE NOTES When a building is burned, the law presumes the fire was caused by accident rather than by a deliberate act. Augustine v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 120, 306 S.E.2d 886, 1983 Va. LEXIS 276 (1983). Elements of offense.  To establish arson, the Commonwealth must prove the fire was of incendiary origin and that the accused was a guilty agent in the burning. Augustine v. Commonwealt h, 226 Va. 120, 306 S.E.2d 886, 1983 Va. LEXIS 276 (1983); Avila v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 472 (Va. Ct. App. June 27, 2000). In order to support a conviction for arson, it is essential that the evidence reveal that the fire was of incendiary origin and that it point unerringly to the gu ilty party. Plowden v. Commonwealth, No. 1620-96-2 (Ct. of Appeals June 10, 1997). Term anything in § 18.2-77 refers to the accelerant used to start the fire of a dwelling, not the object of the fire; the statutory language proscribes the setting fire to anything, by the burning whereof such occupied dwelling house is burned. Schwartz v. Commonwealth, 267 Va. 751, 594 S.E.2d 925, 2004 Va. LEXIS 72 (2004). Corpus delicti must consist of proof that the fire was of incendiary, rather than of accidental origin. In this respect the defense is aided by a presumption that the fire was caused by accident. But this presumption is rebuttable. Cook v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 427, 309 S.E.2d 325, 1983 Va. LEXIS 301 (1983). Arson may be proved by circumstantial evidence where all the circumstances of time, plac e, motive, means, opportunity and conduct concur in pointing out the accused as the perpetrator of the crime. Avila v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 472 (Va. Ct. App. June 27, 2000). Circumstantial evidence of criminal agency in an arson case must point unerringly to the defendant. But this amounts to no more and no less than a requirement that the evidence must exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, the standard applicable to every criminal case. Cook v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 427, 309 S.E.2d 325, 1983 Va. LEXIS 301 (1983). When the Commonwealth relies upon circumstantial evidence, it is essential not only that the evidence reveal that the fire was of incendiary origin, but it must a lso point unerringly to the guilty party. Augustine v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 120, 306 S.E.2d 886, 1983 Va. LEXIS 276 (1983). It is sufficient where every reasonable hypothesis of innocence is excluded.  Arson stands upon no different footing than any other criminal offense. Where circumstantial evidence is sufficient to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of inno cence, it is sufficient to support a conviction. The hypotheses which must be thus excluded are those which flow from the evidence itself, and not from the imaginations of defense counsel. Cook v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 427, 309 S.E.2d 325, 1983 Va. LEXIS 301 (1983). Language of section should be followed in indictment.  In indictments for statutory offenses, the language of the statute defining the offense should be strictly followed. Howel v. Commonwealth, 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 664, 1848 Va. LEXIS 54 (1848). Ownership need not be in indictment.  To prove the dwelling-house element under this section, the Commonwealth need not establish ownership of the premises, only routine habitation, and an allegation in an indictment that the property the defendant had set on fire was owned by a named individual was thus a circumstance immaterial to the offense and clearly unnecessary to a successful prosecution of the indictment. Alston v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 661, 529 S.E.2d 851, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 460 (2000). Use of word burn is essential.  In an indictment for arson, it is not sufficient to use the words set fire to the house; but the word burn must be used, that being the word emplo yed in this section to define the offense. Howel v. Commonwealth, 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 664, 1848 Va. LEXIS 54 (1848). Time of burning must be charged.  To convict of the offense of burning at night, it seems that the indictment must charge the burning in the night. Curran's Case, 48 Va. (7 Gratt.) 619, 1850 Va. L EXIS 45 (1850). Though the offense of burning in the daytime may be charged in the common-law form, omitting to state whether the burning was in the night or daytime, yet it is m ore appropriate to charge the burning in the daytime. Curran's Case, 48 Va. (7 Gratt.) 619, 1850 Va. LEXIS 45 (1850). Term dwelling house means place which human beings regularly use for sleeping ev en though the occupants are temporarily absent. Marable v. Commonwealth, 27 Va. App. 505, 500 S.E.2d 233, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 357 (1998). A dwelling referred to as temporarily unoccupied is one that is currently uninhabited, not one from which its occupants are merely absent at the time it is burned. Davis v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 6, 427 S.E.2d 441, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1021, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (1993). Despite that legislature subsequently deleted the word temporarily from statute, it should not be construed to require proof that one or more people were physically present in the dwelling at the time of the burning. Marable v. Commonwealth, 27 Va. App. 505, 500 S.E.2d 233, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 357 (1998). Use of term unoccupied was not intended to reduce punishment for violation of th is section where the occupant or occupants are merely temporarily absent, but continue to reside there. Marable v. Commonwealth, 27 Va. App. 505, 500 S.E.2d 233, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 357 (1998). Absence of occupants.  When the defendant burned the house in which he and others lived, he was guilty of a Class 2 felony, rather than a Class 3 felony, even though no one was in the h ouse at the time. Davis v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 6, 427 S.E.2d 441, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1021, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (1993). Question whether fire is of incendiary or of accidental origin is a question of fact whi ch must often turn upon the weight of circumstantial evidence. Cook v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 427, 309 S.E.2d 325, 1983 Va. LEXIS 301 (1983). When a fact finder has accepted the testimony of a qualified expert witness, which negat es every reasonable possibility that a fire was of accidental origin, the Supreme Court cannot hold the evidence insufficient, as a matter of law, to support a finding that the fire was of incendiary origin. Cook v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 427, 309 S.E.2d 325, 1983 Va. LEXIS 301 (1983). Felony obstruction.  Attempted arson fell within the proscribed offenses in the felony obstruction statute because the language of the obstruction statute, whe...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-78"><akn:num>§ 18.2-78</akn:num><akn:heading>What not deemed dwelling house</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text No outhouse, not adjoining a dwelling house, nor under the same roof, although within the curtilage thereof, shall be deemed a part of such dwelling house, within the m eaning of this chapter, unless some person usually lodge therein at night.

It declares nothing necessary to be noticed in pleading , either in the indictment or elsewhere. It is a mere incident to § 18.2-77, and a mere limitation of the words dwelling house therein mentioned. Page v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 943, 1875 Va. LEXIS 67 (1875). When outhouse deemed a dwelling house.  To make an outhouse, not adjoining a dwelling house nor under the same roof, a dwelling house, two things must appear: First, that the outhouse is within the curt ilage of a dwelling house, and occupied therewith; and, second, that some person usually lodges therein at night.

At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, institution of higher education was substituted for college in text of this section to conform t o Acts 2016, c. 588. The 1997 amendment rewrote the first sentence which formerly read: If any person maliciously burn, or by the use of any explosive device or substance, maliciously destroy, in whole or in part, or cause to be burned or destroyed, or aid, counsel, or procure the burning or destroying, of any meeting house, courthouse, townhouse, college, academy, schoolhouse, or other building erected for public use, except an asylum, hotel, jail or prison, or any banking house, warehouse, storehouse, manufactory, mill, or other house, whether the property of himself or of another person, not usually occupied by persons lodging therein at night, at a time when any person is therein, or if he maliciously set fire to anything, or cause to be set on fire, or aid, counsel, or procure the setting on fire of anything, by the burning whereof any building mentioned in this section shall be burned, at a time when any person is therein, he shall be guilty of a Class 3 felony and substituted is guilty for be guilty  in the second sentence.

CASE NOTES Any burning sufficient.  The amount of burning necessary to support a conviction pursuant to this section is any amount, provided there is a perceptible wasting of the fiber of the buildi ng or object which is the subject of arson. Calderon v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 475 (Va. Ct. App. June 27, 2000). Only a slight burning is necessary for the purposes of conviction under this section. Hancock v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 774, 407 S.E.2d 301, 8 Va. Law Rep. 52, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 172 (1991). Malice required for arson same as malice required for other common-law crimes.  No Virginia case distinguishes the malice which is a necessary element of arson from the malice which has been required in other common-law crimes; malice inheres in the doing of a wrongful act intentionally, or without just cause or excuse, or as a result of ill will. It may be directly evidenced by words, or inferred from acts and conduct which necessarily result in injury and its existence is a question of fa ct to be determined by the trier of fact. Bell v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 530, 399 S.E.2d 450, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1195, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 2 (1991). Retail store was storehouse.  Country store was a storehouse, as it had a room where grain or feed was stored and it could also be inferred from the evidence that the goods sold at the store were stored there until purchased by customers. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. App. 9, 781 S.E.2d 754, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 33 (2016). Evidence held sufficient.  Where evidence showed that defendant either doused cushion with gasoline or placed the cushion and used the match to ignite the gasoline, either act was sufficien t to constitute arson in violation of this section. Hancock v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 774, 407 S.E.2d 301, 8 Va. Law Rep. 52, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 172 (1991). Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction for arson, for setting fire to an unoccupied building, in violation of § 18.2-79. Though circumsta ntial, the evidence showed that: (1) defendant threatened to burn down the structure after defendant was ejected from the property following a disagreement with another person; (2) defendant threatened to burn the structure down; (3) defendant was presen t at the time of the fire; (4) an accelerant was used to start the fire; and (5) defendant fled when defendant was confronted. Sloan v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 452 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 7, 2008). Because the trial courts finding that the country store was storehouse was supported by credible evidence, a rational trier of fact could have found t hat defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of attempted arson of a storehouse.

CASE NOTES Indi ctment should describe building with particularity.  An indictment under this section must describe the building with such particularity as will inform accused what building is meant. Richards v. Commonwealth, 81 Va . 110, 1885 Va. LEXIS 15 (1885). Accidental burning presumed.  Where a building or structure is burned, the presumption is that the fire was caused by accident, rather than by the act of the accused accompanied by a deliberat e intent. Simmons v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 778, 160 S.E.2d 569, 1968 Va. LEXIS 182 (1968). Burden of proof.  To establish the offense against the defendant, the Commonwealth had the burden of proving that the fire which burned the railway companys bridge was of incen diary origin and that the defendant was the guilty agent in the burning. Simmons v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 778, 160 S.E.2d 569, 1968 Va. LEXIS 182 (1968). To support a conviction under this section, the Commonwealth has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt both that the fire was incendiary and that the accu sed was the criminal agent. Jefferson v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 620 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 22, 2000). Indictment held sufficient.  When an indictment charged that the accused did feloniously burn a certain barn and property therein, said barn and the property therein being the property of one H.H. Dulaney, and situated in the county aforesaid, which said barn and the property therein was then and there of the value of $1,500, the indictment was sufficient under this section. Wolf v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 833, 1878 Va. LEXI S 99 (1878). Evidence as to value of bu ilding prior to fire.  It was not error for the trial court to refuse to strike the evidence of an expert who testified that the value of the burned building, before the fire, would hav e exceeded the minimum threshold for a felony conviction under this section, on grounds that his reasoning was faulty and that he had no experience in this kind of appraisal. The validity of the reasoning process by which an expert reaches his opinion is within the province of the trier of fact, and goes only to the weight to be accorded to his opinion. Addison v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 713, 299 S.E.2d 521, 1983 Va. LEXIS 182 (1983). Evidence held sufficient.  Evidence held sufficient where the defendant was at the location of the shed that was burned, alone and out of sight of any witness, only minutes before the fire started, she was admittedly angry at the owner and displayed this anger by intentionally denting a car just after leaving the shed, and where the defendant admitted that she was smoking just before she went to the shed and after. Jefferson v. Commonwealt h, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 620 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 22, 2000). Evidence was insufficient to sustain defendants conviction under this section. Simmo ns v.

Rev. 1206 (1972). For note, Predicate Offenses for First Degree Felony Murder in Virginia, see 57 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 561 (2000). CASE NOTES Construction.  Because the burning of personal property with intent to defraud as defined under § 18.2-81 substantially corresponded to the generic definition of arson for th e purposes of 18 U.S.C.S. § 924(e), the district court did not err in finding that defendants conviction under § 18.2-81 qualified as a predicate conviction for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act. United States v. Craig, 236 Fed. Appx. 8 63, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 12903 (4th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 909, 128 S. Ct. 254, 169 L. Ed. 2d 186, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 10129 (2007), dismissed, No. 5:06-cr-00030, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60805 (W.D. Va. Apr. 21, 2017). Section 19.2-284 has no application to proving a violation of this section; this section is silent on the issue of ownership. This section proscribes not only burning another persons property, but the broader offense of burning any property with malice or the intent to defraud an insurance company or another person; thus, this section r equires proof only of malice or intent to defraud. Proof of ownership, or of an insurable interest, is not an element of malicious burning under this section, and § 19.2-284 does not make it such. Hamm v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 150, 428 S.E.2d 517, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1115, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (1993). Corpus delicti must consist of proof that the fire was of incendiary, rather than of accidental origin. In this respect the defense is aided by a presumption that the fire was caused by accident. But this presumption is rebuttable. Cook v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 427, 309 S.E.2d 325, 1983 Va. LEXIS 301 (1983). Malice in the case of arson is not necessarily a feeling of ill will toward another person, but may be a purposeful intent to do a wrongful act. Consequently, malice may be inferred from the fact that a person intentionally burned insured property for the purpose of defrauding or injuring an insurance carrier. Hamm v. Commonwealth , 16 Va. App. 150, 428 S.E.2d 517, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1115, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (1993). Malice.  In a case in which defendant was convicted of maliciously burning an occupied dwelling and maliciously burning personal property valued in excess of $200, the Com monwealth produced evidence sufficient to enable a trier of fact to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted with malice. Although defendant maintained that he set the fire in order to burn his own mementos of his ex-girlfriend, the evide nce demonstrated that defendant purposely set the fire inside and took only minimal steps to contain it. Yergovich v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 245 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 20, 2016). When defendant was charged with multiple arson counts, the single larceny doctrine did not bar his convictions, because he was charged with the statutory offense of arson, not larceny, this doctrine was only applied to those statutory offenses for which no legislative intent to abrogate the theory of common law larceny could be ascertaine d, and the plain language of §§ 18.2-77 and 18.2-81 showed the legislatures intention to allow multiple arson convictions in certain circumstances. Schwartz v. Commonwealth, 41 Va. App. 61, 581 S.E.2d 891, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 339 (2003), aff'd, 267 Va. 751, 594 S.E.2d 925, 2004 Va. LEXIS 72 (2004). Circumstantial evidence of criminal agency in an arson case must point unerringly to the defendant. But this amounts to no more and no less than a requirement that the evidence must exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, the standard applicable to every criminal case. Cook v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 427, 309 S.E.2d 325, 1983 Va. LEXIS 301 (1983). It is sufficient where every reasonable hypothesis of innocence is excluded.  Arson stands upon no different footing than any other criminal offense. Where circumstantial evidence is sufficient to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of inno cence, it is sufficient to support a conviction. The hypotheses which must be thus excluded are those which flow from the evidence itself, and not from the imaginations of defense counsel. Cook v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 427, 309 S.E.2d 325, 1983 Va. LEXIS 301 (1983). Question whether fire is of incendiary or of accidental origin is a question of fact whi ch must often turn upon the weight of circumstantial evidence. Cook v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 427, 309 S.E.2d 325, 1983 Va. LEXIS 301 (1983). When a fact finder has accepted the testimony of a qualified expert witness, which negat es every reasonable possibility that a fire was of accidental origin, the Supreme Court cannot hold the evidence insufficient, as a matter of law, to support a finding that the fire was of incendiary origin. Cook v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 427, 309 S.E.2d 325, 1983 Va. LEXIS 301 (1983). Intent to defraud insurance company may also be malicious burning.  The fact that this section includes a separate provision for burning with intent to defraud an insurance company does not exclude that wrongful act as bei ng an act of malicious burning; this section separately identifies a common species of malicious burning, which, prior to the enactment of this section, was defined separately and punished differently from other acts of malicious burning. (See former Cod e §§ 18.1-79 and 18.1-85.).Hamm v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 150, 428 S.E.2d 517, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1115, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (1993). Conviction bars recovery on insurance policy.  In an action on a fire insurance policy brought after the plaintiff had been convicted under this section, the question whether or not the plaintiff fraudulently destroyed, or connived at the destruction of, his own property for the purpose of securing the insurance is identical with that which was heard and determined against him in the criminal prosecution, and while it is not res judicata as against the insura nce company, the plaintiff should not be permitted to reopen the question and avoid the legal effect of the judgment of conviction by a collateral attack upon it. If the defendant could succeed in such an action, he would thereby avoid the logical conseq uences of his conviction. Eagle, Star &amp; British Dominions Ins. Co. v. Heller, 149 Va. 82, 140 S.E. 314, 1927 Va. LEXIS 178 (1927). Clause vitiating section is against public policy.  It would be against public policy to write into a contract of fire insurance a provision that the assured might recover even though convicted under this section o f burning the property with intent to defraud the insurer. Eagle, Star &amp; British Dominions Ins. Co. v. Heller, 149 Va. 82, 140 S.E. 314, 1927 Va. LEXIS 178 (1927). Unit of prosecution.  Section 18.2-81, by its plain language, created a single and separate unit of prosecution for each item of personal property destroyed as the result of arson. Sch wartz v. Commonwealth, 41 Va. App. 61, 581 S.E.2d 891, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 339 (2003), aff'd, 267 Va. 751, 594 S.E.2d 925, 2004 Va. LEXIS 72 (2004). By separate statutes, the legislature has criminalized the arson of an occupied dwelling, on the one hand, § 18.2-77, and the arson of personal property, § 18.2-81, on the other. Therefore, where defendant burned a dwelling and two separate vehicles, the legislature intended that there should be three units of prosecution, for the burning of the dwelling and for the burning of each vehicle. Schwartz v. Comm onwealth, 267 Va. 751, 594 S.E.2d 925, 2004 Va. LEXIS 72 (2004). The Commonwealths evidence was sufficient to support appellants arson conviction . Virginia v. Commonwealth, 17 Va.

For note, Predicate Offenses for First Degree Felony Murder in Virginia, see 57 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 561 (2000). CASE NOTES Legislative intent.  The legislative intent was not to exclude burnings proscribed by other sections of the arson chapter, but rather to enlarge the compass of the chapter by includin g burnings not otherwise proscribed. Such a building, a multi-purpose structure which ill fits the limited definition of buildings mentioned elsewhere in the chapter, falls squarely within the meaning of any building or other structure. Knight v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 85, 300 S.E.2d 600, 1983 Va. LEXIS 194 (1983). This section requires the Commonwealth to prove that the burning occurred while the accu sed was in the building with intent to commit a felony. Knight v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 85, 300 S.E.2d 600, 1983 Va. LEXIS 194 (1983).

Law Review. For article, Preclusion of Evidence of Criminal Conviction in Civil Action Arising from the Same Incident, see 10 G.M.U. L. Rev. 107 (1988). CASE NOTES This section is not vague.  A threat, in the criminal context, is recognized to be a communication avowing an intent to injure anothers person or property. The communication, taken in i ts particular context, must reasonably cause the receiver to believe that the speaker will act according to his expression of intent. Perkins v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 7, 402 S.E.2d 229, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1846, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1991). Section is not overbroad.  A claim that a statute on its face contains no requirement of mens rea or scienter is no ground for holding the statute unconstitutional since such requirement wi ll be read into the statute by the court when it appears the legislature implicitly intended that it must be proved. Perkins v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 7, 402 S.E.2d 229, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1846, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1991). Elements of offense.  Nothing in the statutes plain language carved out threats to burn or bomb ones own property from the scope of the offense; therefore, the statutes pla in language prohibited threatening to burn or bomb any means of transportation regardless of ownership. Howard v. Commonwealth, 74 Va. App. 739, 872 S.E.2d 212, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 140 (2022). In order to sustain a conviction under the statute, the communication must be taken in context, must have been maliciously made, and must reasonably cause the rec eiver of the threat to believe that the speaker of the threat will act according to his expressed intent. Jones v. Commonwealth, No. 0977-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 23, 1999). This section can be read as requiring a criminal mens rea. Such a narrowing construction of this statute prevents overbreadth. Only an individual who maliciously makes and communicates any threat prohibited by the statute will be punished. Perkins v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 7, 402 S.E.2d 229, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1846, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 28 ( 1991). But intent to carry out threat not required.  The statute does not require the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant intended to carry out his threat to burn the victims house; proof that the threat wa s made and communicated satisfies the statutory requirement. Wyatt v. Commonwealth, No. 0554-97-3 (Ct. of Appeals March 24, 1998). Defendants age is not an essential element of the offense defined in this section. L ambert v. Commonwealth, 9 Va. App. 67, 383 S.E.2d 752, 6 Va. Law Rep. 234, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 122 (1989). Threat defined.  The term threat is defined as an avowed present determination or intent to injure presently or in the future. Parnell v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 342, 42 3 S.E.2d 834, 9 Va. Law Rep. 576, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 283 (1992). This section is not limited to unconditional threats. Henry v. Commonwealth, No. 0520-96 -4 (Ct. of Appeals June 17, 1997). Context must be considered when determining whether words were threat.  In determining whether words were uttered as a threat, the context in which they were uttered must be considered. Parnell v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 342, 423 S. E.2d 834, 9 Va. Law Rep. 576, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 283 (1992). Inst ruction that Commonwealth had to prove true threat.  Trial judge did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that the Commonwealth had to prove a true threat or a serious threat. The statute require s proof of a threat. The adjectives true and serious would have interjected an issue that was not supported by the evidence. Parnell v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 342, 423 S.E.2d 834, 9 Va. Law Rep. 576, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 283 (19 92). Jury instruction on proof of a threat.  Even if the trial judge erred in not more fully explaining to the jury the definition of threat, the omission was harmless error. Parnell v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 342, 423 S.E.2d 834, 9 Va. Law Rep. 576, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 283 (1992). Defendants statement that he will die and his house will burn was admissible , and its probative value outweighed the incidental prejudice that it may have engendered. Parnell v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 342, 423 S.E.2d 834, 9 Va. Law Rep. 576, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 283 (1992). Delay in reporting threat to police.  The fact that the victim did not immediately report the defendants threat to the police did not require a finding that she did not believe that he would commi t the act. Jones v. Commonwealth, No. 0977-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 23, 1999). Relevance of evidence.  Evidence concerning a message that was left a mere three days before a bomb threat was made was not so far removed in time from the charged offense as to render i t irrelevant. Summerlin v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 288, 557 S.E.2d 731, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 17 (2002). In light of the manifest anger and hostility expressed by defendant toward the organization he threatened to bomb, and his hostile voicemail, the evidence present ed was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant made and communicated a threat to bomb a building with the requisite unlawful intent to make and communicate such a threat. Summerlin v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 288, 557 S.E.2d 731, 20 02 Va. App. LEXIS 17 (2002). Defendants wifes testimony and reaction to defendants threat demonstrated her belief that he would follow through on his threat, and his childs te stimony corroborated the reasonableness of the wifes belief; the testimony about defendants training, knowledge, and past behavior provided a basis to conclude that such belief was reasonable, and there was sufficient evidence for the jury to con vict defendant of threatening to burn or bomb. Howard v. Commonwealth, 74 Va. App. 739, 872 S.E.2d 212, 2022 Va.

Text For the purpose of this section: Device means any instrument, apparatus or contrivance, including its component parts, that is capable of producing or intended to produce an explosion but shall not include fireworks as defined in § 27-95. Explosive material means any chemical compound, mechanical mixture or device that is c ommonly used or can be used for the purpose of producing an explosion and which contains any oxidizing and combustive agents or other ingredients in such proportions, quantities or packaging that an ignition by fire, friction, concussion, percussion, det onation or by any part of the compound or mixture may cause a sudden generation of highly heated gases. These materials include, but are not limited to, gunpowder, powders for blasting, high explosives, blasting materials, fuses (other than electric circ uit breakers), detonators, and other detonating agents and smokeless powder. Fire bomb means any container of a flammable material such as gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, or other chemical compound, having a wick composed of any material or a device or other substance which, if set or ignited, is capable of igniting such flammable material or chemical compound but does not include a similar device commercially manuf actured and used solely for the purpose of illumination or cooking. Hoax explosive device means any device which by its design, construction, content or c haracteristics appears to be or to contain a bomb or other destructive device or explosive but which is an imitation of any such device or explosive. Any person who (i) possesses materials with which fire bombs or explosive materials or devices can be made with the intent to manufacture fire bombs or explosive materi als or devices or, (ii) manufactures, transports, distributes, possesses or uses a fire bomb or explosive materials or devices shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. Any person who constructs, uses, places, sends, or causes to be sent any hoax explosive de vice so as to intentionally cause another person to believe that such device is a bomb or explosive shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the authorized manufacture, transportation, distribution, use or possession of any material, substance, or device by a member of the armed forces of the United States, fire fighters or law-enforcement officers, nor shall it prohibit the manufacture, transportation, distribution, use or possession of any material, substance or device to be used solely for scientific research, educa tional purposes or for any lawful purpose, subject to the provisions of §§ 27-97 and 27-97.2.

CASE NOTES Burden of proof on defendant.  Trial court did not violate defendants due process rights by requiring defendant to show that defendant possessed or manufactured explosive materials or devic es for an educational purpose, a scientific purpose, or any lawful purpose, because the last clause of § 18.2-85, constituted a statutory defense for which defendant bore burden of providing supporting evidence. Flanagan v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. App. 6 81, 714 S.E.2d 212, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 274 (2011). Sufficient evidence of fir e bomb possession.  There was sufficient evidence to support the trial courts finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the fire bomb where defendant was a passe nger in vehicle; the fire bomb was found on the vehicles passenger side floorboard; defendant was aware of the objects presence in the vehicle; and although defendant denied knowledge that the object was a fire bomb, the trial court found his tes timony to be totally incredible. The trial court was entitled to infer from defendants totally incredible testimony that defendant had lied about his knowledge of the nature of the fire bomb, as well as the events surrounding his arrest, to c onceal his guilt. Benton v. Commonwealth, No. 1510-96-1 (Ct. of Appeals May 13, 1997). Defendants felony convictions for possession of materials with which explosive materials could be made with intent to manufacture such materials in violation of clause (i) and possession of explosive materials in violation of clause (ii) did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions even though defendant had been convicted of violating Norfolk City, Va., Code § § 17.1-43 and 17.1-44(25) because each of the misdemeanor and felony offenses required an element of proof the other offenses did not; sections 17.1-43 and 17.1-44(25) required findings of a dangerous condition liable to cause or contribute to a fire and that a defendant possessed or manufactured fireworks, convictions under clauses (i) and (ii) of this section did not, and a conviction under clause (ii) required a showing that defendant possessed prohibited items other than fireworks. Saunders v. Co mmonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 384 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 6, 2011). No double jeopardy bar.  Defendants felony convictions for possession of materials with which explosive materials could be made with intent to manufacture such materials in violation of clause (i) and possession of explosive materials in violation of clause (ii) did not violate § 19.2-294 even though defendant had been convicted of violating Norfolk City, Va., Code §§ 17.1-43 and 17.1-44(25) because § 19.2-294 did not bar convictions for felony and misdemeanor charges based on the same act as long as those charges were prosecuted in a single, concurrent evidentiary hearing. Saunders v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 384 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 6, 2011). Su fficient evidence of possession of explosive materials.  Evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant clearly possessed explosive materials in violation of § 18.2-85 because among the items found in defendants possession was gunpowder, which was, by explicit statutory designation, explosive material; the trial court explicitly found that defendant was not found guilty under the indictments with respect to firebombs or explosive devices but as to explosive materials. Saunders v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 384 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 6, 2011). Trial court properly convicted defendant of manufacturing, possessing, or using an explosive device because, while he stated that he intended to make a founta in firework, his cell phone contained numerous text messages indicating that he had arranged to assemble a bomb, the devices were metal pipes, sealed at both ends but for a small drill hole for a fuse, and filled with explosive material taken from fi reworks and possession of an illegal firework was not a lesser-included offense where fireworks were expressly excluded from the offense. Callahan v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 280 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 6, 2015). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No double jeopardy bar.  Double jeopardy pursuant to Va. Const., art. I, § 8, U.S. Const., amend. V, or § 19.2-294 did not bar defendants felony prosecution for charges stemming from the making and storing of hazardous materials for the purpose of manufacturing fireworks, violations of §§ 18.2-85, 10.1-1455, after he pleaded guilty to violations of Norfolk, Va. City Code §§ 17.1-43 and 17.1-44(25), because each of t he four statutes required different elements of proof. Commonwealth v. Saunders, 78 Va. Cir. 345, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 173 (Norfolk May 27, 2009). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Explosive materials.  Tannerite, like many other substances, is an explosive material within the meaning of § 182-85, but its use or possession is not illegal so long as the use or possession is for a lawful purpose such as the recreational use for which it is intended. Whether any particular use or possession of Tannerite is for an illegal purpose would be a question of fact. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Willi am W.

Burglary and Housebreaking, §§ 2-5, 9, 10. CASE NOTES The term dwelling house in this section means a place which human beings regular ly use for sleeping. Turner v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 88, 531 S.E.2d 619, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 566 (2000). Following principles demonstrate how a house must be regularly used to qualify as a dwelling under § 18.2-89: (1) a person may have multiple dwelling h ouses, and each dwelling house must have humans sleep in it and engage in other functions typically associated with habitation; (2) the house must be maintained to make it suitable for immediate or rapid habitation; (3) a person must inhabit the house on a usual or periodic basis; and (4) when the occupant is absent, he or she must intend to return to the house within a usual or periodic time. Giles v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 449, 658 S.E.2d 703, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 167 (2008), aff'd, 277 Va. 369, 672 S.E.2d 879, 2009 Va. LEXIS 42 (2009). A dwelling is no longer a dwelling house for purposes of this section when its o ccupants leave it without any intention to return. Rash v. Commonwealth, 9 Va. App. 22, 383 S.E.2d 749, 6 Va. Law Rep. 208, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 116 (1989). Defendants burglary conviction was reversed where the house that defendant broke into and entered was no longer a dwelling house for purposes of § 18.2-89 since the homeowners testimony disclosed he had already left the property with no intent to return to the house. Barts v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2002). Vacation hom e is dwelling house even when unoccupied.  Court of appeals did not err in affirming a circuit courts ruling that the house defendant broke into satisfied the dwelling house requirement of § 18.2-89 because the house was analogous to a vacation home; vacation homes are dwelling houses even when unoccupied at the time of a break in. Giles v. Commonwealth, 277 Va. 369, 672 S.E.2d 879, 2009 Va. LEXIS 42 (2009). Commonwealth satisfied its burden of proving that the structure defendant broke into was used as a habitation to satisfy the dwelling house requirement of § 18.2-89 because the contents of the house and evidence of the owners behavior in relation to the house were probative of whether it was used periodically for the purpose of habitation; a house is a dwelling house pursuant to § 18.2-89 when t he house is used for habitation, including periodic habitation, and periodic habitation does not require that the house be used at regular intervals but rather requires that when the house is used, it is used for the purpose of habitation. Giles v. Commo nwealth, 277 Va. 369, 672 S.E.2d 879, 2009 Va. LEXIS 42 (2009). Structure does not have to be physically inhabited every day or week or month to be a dwelling house when the danger to personal safety that is sought to be prote cted does not dissipate simply because the structure is not occupied on a regular basis; the danger continues irrespective of frequency of habitation so long as when the structure is used, it is used for the purpose of habitation, and a dwelling house do es not lose its character as such simply because a person is absent for either a regular or irregular period of time. Giles v. Commonwealth, 277 Va. 369, 672 S.E.2d 879, 2009 Va. LEXIS 42 (2009). Evidence of dwelling house.  Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to show that a house was a dwelling because the owner of the house slept there about one weekend per month, and the hou se was maintained for immediate occupancy; habitation sufficient to constitute a dwelling house under § 18.2-89 includes maintenance for reasonably prompt habitation and at a minimum periodic habitation. Giles v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 449, 658 S.E .2d 703, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 167 (2008), aff'd, 277 Va. 369, 672 S.E.2d 879, 2009 Va. LEXIS 42 (2009). Statutory burglary conviction under § 18.2-91 was improper as the house involved in the burglary was not a dwelling house, as that term was defined in §§ 18.2-89, 18.2-90, and 18.2-91, in that the record contained no evidence that the house was used for habitation as no one slept there, the house was unfurnished, and no one used it for the usual activities of life. Additionally, there was no evid ence that anyone who had used the house for habitation had any intention of resuming that use. Johns v. Commonwealth, 53 Va. App. 742, 675 S.E.2d 211, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 172 (2009). Sufficient evidence that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon.  In a prosecution on a charge of burglary while armed with a deadly weapon, the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon when he entered the victims home as the evidence showed that defendant admitted to the police that he obtained the knife from another home, that he entered the home through the screened-in porch, that the screen had been cut, and that a knife was recover ed near the victims keys, which were laying in a neighbors yard. It was a reasonable inference that the recovered knife was the knife used to attack the victim, especially since the victim testified that the recovered knife did not belong to her. Morales v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 452 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2010). Intent constitutes an essential part of the crime of burglary and should be both alleged and proved. Vaughn v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 758, 1853 Va. LEXIS 80 (1853). Specific intent is an essential element of the crime of statutory burglary and it is necessary for the intent to be established as a matter of fact before a convi ction can be had. Williams v. Peyton, 414 F.2d 776, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 11402 (4th Cir. 1969). Specific intent is an essential element of burglary. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 207 Va. 326, 150 S.E.2d 135, 1966 Va. LEXIS 224 (1966). Intent is almost always established by circumstantial evidence. Williams v. Peyton, 414 F .2d 776, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 11402 (4th Cir. 1969). Intent to commit felony may be infer red.  The intent to commit a felony may be inferred from the defendants unauthorized presence in a building at night. Witt v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 215, 422 S.E .2d 465, 9 Va. Law Rep. 365, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 250 (1992). Sufficient evidence supported a burglary conviction, although defendant was discovered in an apartment before any theft took place, where defendants intent to commit larceny was implied when defendant entered the apartment only after witnessing its occupant leave and defendants testimony regarding the reason for entering the apartment was not credible. Newby v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 210 (Va. C t. App. May 18, 2010). Conviction rever sed where incorrect intent shown.  Defendants conviction for breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny was reversed, where circumstantial evidence showing a nighttime entry and assaul t of a female resident reflected an intent to rape or ravish rather than an intent to steal from the victim. Maynard v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 15, 389 S.E.2d 910, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1687, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 36 (1990). Intent to do serious physical harm.  Defendants burglary conviction in violation of § 18.2-89 was appropriate because the evidence was sufficient and the trial court was entitled to draw on al l the circumstances shown by the evidence to determine what defendants intent actually was when he entered the victims apartment. Considering defendants prior robbery of the victim, defendants threat to the victim with a gun a few hours e arlier, and defendants threats to the victim as he was unlawfully entering the victims apartment, it was appropriately determined that defendant intended to do serious physical harm to the victim at the time of entry. Young v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 164 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 27, 2010). Breaking which will constitute burglary may be actual or constructive. Clarke v. Commonwe alth, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 908, 1874 Va. LEXIS 88 (1874). Constructive breaking includes entrance effected by threats, fraud, or conspiracy.

The offense of housebreaking is purely statutory in Virginia. Williams v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 764, 71 S.E.2d 73, 1952 Va. LEXIS 189 (1952). Offense qualifie s as a generic burglary.  Defendants offenses that were in violation of §§ 18.2-90 and 18.2-91 did qualify as generic burglaries, for purposes of 18 U.S.C.S. § 924(e). United States v. Joshua, 259 F. Supp. 2d 446, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6963 (E.D. Va. 2003). In a case in which defendant pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. § 922(g)(1), and he objected to the assert ion in his presentence report that he qualified as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.S. § 924(e), he argued unsuccessfully that one of the offenses the probation report cited as a predicate offense failed to qualif y. Under §§ 18.2-90 and 18.2-91, defendants offense of breaking and entering a shop with the intent to commit larceny qualified as generic burglary under the Armed Career Criminal Act, and, under the modified categorical approach, the appropria te documents necessarily established that he pled guilty to and was convicted of generic burglary. United States v. Baxter, 677 F. Supp. 2d 918, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1678 (W.D. Va. 2010), aff'd, 642 F.3d 475, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 8476 (4th Cir. 2011). In a case in which defendant was sentenced to 27 months of imprisonment for violating 18 U.S.C.S. § 922(g)(1), the district court incorrectly found that the Ar med Career Criminal Act did not apply to defendant. Defendant had three violations of § 18.2-90, and, contrary to the district courts determination, his breaking and entering of a restaurant and a market were generic burglaries under the Armed Car eer Criminal Act. United States v. Foster, 662 F.3d 291, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 23807 (4th Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 859, 133 S. Ct. 207, 184 L. Ed. 2d 107, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 6146 (2012). Offense could not count as Armed Career Criminal Act predicate.  Because the Virginia burglary statute defines the crime of burglary more broadly than the generic definition, no conviction under the law could count as an Armed Career Criminal Act predicate; the generic burglary requires breaking into a building or premises permanently attached to real property, but the first grouping of locations in § 18.2-90 includes water and rail vehicles and the second grouping involves only mobile vehicles. United States v. Payne, 248 F. Supp. 3d 757, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50316 (W.D. Va. 2017). Relationship to Armed Career Criminal Act.  Defendants conviction for Virginia burglary committed with the intent to murder did not necessarily involve the use of force for Armed Career Criminal Act pur poses because § 18.2-90 did not require any factual finding that the defendant used, attempted to use, or threatened to use violent physical force. United States v. Al-Muwwakkil, 983 F.3d 748, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 40258 (4th Cir. 2020). This section is limited by § 18.2-78. Compton v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 48, 55 S.E.2d 4 46, 1949 Va. LEXIS 260 (1949). Timing of offense is not essential element of offense.  Whenever there is a breaking and entering of a dwelling with a larcenous intent, the timing of the offense is not an essential element of the offense. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 409, 412 S.E.2d 709, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1565, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (1991). Since breaking and entering of a dwelling, at any time, is the essential element of the offense, the indictments allegation that the offense occurred in the daytime was nothing more than surplusage. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 409, 412 S.E.2d 709, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1565, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (1991). Because breaking and entering a dwelling at any time with the requisite intent is a violation of this section, the specification daytime was neith er legally essential to charge a violation of the statute nor varied the conduct which the statute proscribes. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 409, 412 S.E.2d 709, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1565, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (1991). Unnecessary words that describe, limit or qualify statutory necessary words must be proved.  Where unnecessary words in an indictment describe, limit or qualify the statutory necessary words, the unnecessary words have to be proven as charged. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 409, 412 S.E.2d 709, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1565, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (1991). The addition of the word daytime in the defendants indictment more particularly defined the term any time, the general span of time within whi ch the conduct of breaking and entering the dwelling is statutorily described; the phrase any time is not, however, a statutorily necessary word. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 409, 412 S.E.2d 709, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1565, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 3 18 (1991). Evidence sufficient to show that appellant entered home after sunset.  Evidence at trial was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant entered victims home after sunset. Although victim returned home when it wa s not fully dark, she put away her groceries, sat to watch television, and heard him enter after she turned the lights on. Dailey v. Commonwealth, No. 0555-97-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 9, 1997). The addition of daytime was surplusage that designated the general time of the offense but did not describe, limit, or qualify the conduct which is statut orily proscribed. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 409, 412 S.E.2d 709, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1565, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (1991). This section and § 18.2-91 might well have been combined, for they refer directly, th ough not solely, to, and define as an offense, the breaking and entering of a dwelling house in the daytime, with intent to commit murder, rape or robbery (this section) or larceny, or any felony other than murder, rape, or robbery (§ 18.2-91). The ov ert acts constituting the crime are the same  that is, the breaking and entering. The intent with which the particular crime is committed does not change its general nature or character, because whichever intent is shown, the crime is of the same nat ure  that is, a felony of the specific class denounced by these sections. Sullivan v. Commonwealth, 157 Va. 867, 161 S.E. 297, 1931 Va. LEXIS 344 (1931). Under this and the following section, housebreaking or storebreaking, as a consummated crime, includes both a nighttime entry without breaking and a breaking and entry in the daytime or nighttime under stated conditions, as precisely the same felony. An attempt to commit the offense may be perpetrated either by the attempt to enter without breaking or by the attempt to break and enter. Willoughby v. Smyth, 194 Va . 267, 72 S.E.2d 636, 1952 Va. LEXIS 228 (1952). II.Elements of Offense. A.Intent. Specific intent is an essential element of burglary. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 207 Va. 326 , 150 S.E.2d 135, 1966 Va. LEXIS 224 (1966). Intent must be proved.  Where a statute makes an offense consist of an act combined with a particular intent, such intent is as necessary to be proved as the act itself, and it is necess ary for the intent to be established as a matter of fact before a conviction can be had. Surmise and speculation as to the existence of the intent are not sufficient, and no intent in law or mere legal presumption, differing from the intent in fact, can be allowed to supply the place of the latter. Dixon v. Commonwealth, 197 Va. 380, 89 S.E.2d 344, 1955 Va. LEXIS 231 (1955).

How ever, if the person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 felony. History History.

Entering. C. Dwelling House, etc. III. Deadly Weapon. IV. Indictment. V. Prosecution and Conviction. VI. Illustrative Cases. I.In General. Offense describe d in section is a felony.  Breaking and entering a house in the nighttime, with intent to commit larceny, is a felony. Benton v. Commonwealth, 91 Va. 782, 21 S.E. 495, 1895 Va. LEXIS 75 (18 95) (see also Benton v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 570, 16 S.E. 725 (1893)). Section is limited by § 18.2-78. Compton v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 48, 55 S.E.2d 446, 1 949 Va. LEXIS 260 (1949). Elements.  To sustain a conviction for statutory burglary under this section, the commonwealth must prove: (1) The accused entered a dwelling house in the nighttime without breaking or broke and entered the dwelling house in the daytime and (2) The accused entered with the intent to commit any felony other than murder, rape, robbery or arson. Robertson v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. App. 814, 525 S.E.2d 640, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 17 7 (2000). Offense qualifie s as a generic burglary.  Defendants offenses that were in violation of §§ 18.2-90 and 18.2-91 did qualify as generic burglaries, for purposes of 18 U.S.C.S. § 924(e). United States v. Joshua, 259 F. Supp. 2d 446, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6963 (E.D. Va. 2003). In a case in which defendant pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. § 922(g)(1), and he objected to the assert ion in his presentence report that he qualified as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.S. § 924(e), he argued unsuccessfully that one of the offenses the probation report cited as a predicate offense failed to qualif y. Under §§ 18.2-90 and 18.2-91, defendants offense of breaking and entering a shop with the intent to commit larceny qualified as generic burglary under the Armed Career Criminal Act, and, under the modified categorical approach, the appropria te documents necessarily established that he pled guilty to and was convicted of generic burglary. United States v. Baxter, 677 F. Supp. 2d 918, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1678 (W.D. Va. 2010), aff'd, 642 F.3d 475, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 8476 (4th Cir. 2011). Shop.  Use of the term shop in the indictment to which defendant pled guilty did not take his conviction in violation of § 18.2-90 outside the sweep of Taylor or the meaning of burglary under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.S. § 924(e). Rather the reference to shop necessarily established that his prior burglary conviction was based on his entry into a structure affixed to the groun d, namely, a building. United States v. Baxter, 642 F.3d 475, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 8476 (4th Cir. 2011). The Commonwealth can establish a prima facie case that a defendant broke and entered by: (1) proving that goods were stolen from a house which was broken into; (2) justifying the inference that both offenses were committed at the same time, by the same person, as part of the same criminal enterprise and (3) proving that the goods were found soon thereafter in the possession of the accused. Rosser v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 762 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 28, 2000). Unnecessary words that describe, limit or qualify statutory necessary words must be proved.  Unnecessary words in an indictment describe, limit or qualify the statutory necessary words and, thus, the unnecessary words have to be proven as charged. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 409, 412 S.E.2d 709, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1565, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (1991). The addition of the word daytime in the defendants indictment more particularly defined the term any time, the general span of time within whi ch the conduct of breaking and entering the dwelling is statutorily described; the phrase any time is not, however, a statutorily necessary word. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 409, 412 S.E.2d 709, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1565, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 3 18 (1991). The addition of daytime was surplusage that designated the general time of the offense but did not describe, limit, or qualify the conduct which is statut orily proscribed. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 409, 412 S.E.2d 709, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1565, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (1991). Larceny is necessarily invol ved.  In a charge of entering a barn in the night and stealing property therefrom, larceny is necessarily involved. Stallard v. Commonwealth, 130 Va. 769, 107 S.E. 722, 1921 Va. LEXIS 193 (1921). Probable cause for arrest.  Probable cause supported defendants arrest for burglary because when an officer arrived at the victims house, she informed him that defendant was her ex-b oyfriend and did not live there; the officer saw defendant inside the house and observed damage to the door where someone forced entry. Dejesus v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 194 (Va. Ct. App. July 2, 2013). Motion to withdraw guilty plea.  Trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty pleas because defendant did not provide proof of a substantial and reasonable defens e to the charges; even if the testimony that defendant was not in the residence at the time of the burglary was accepted as true, it could still be evidence of his guilt as a principal in the second degree. Ramsey v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. App. 593, 779 S. E.2d 241, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 359 (2015). Trespass not lesser-included offense of statutory burglary.  Trespass in violation of § 18.2-119 is not a lesser-included offense of statutory burglary and a trial court lacks the authority to convict for trespass under an indictment charging breaking and entering even if the accused fails to object. Shifflett v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 843 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2000). Section 18.2-121 is not lesser included offense of § 18.2-90 or this section.  Section 18.2-90, which identifies this sections prohibited acts, includes offenses against properties not specified in § 18.2-121, i.e., ships, vessels, ri ver craft. Thus, a violation of this section will not invariably and necessarily include a violation of § 18.2-121 and the misdemeanor is, consequently, not a lesser included offense of either § 18.2-90 or this section. Crump v. Commonwealth, 13 Va . App. 286, 411 S.E.2d 238, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1460, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (1991). Common-law trespass is not a lesser included offense of statutory burglary under this se ction. Dowell v. Commonwealth, No. 1567-87-2 (Ct. of Appeals May 21, 1991). Common-law trespass is not a lesser included offense of statutory burglary under this section, even when the indictment specifically charges that a dwelling was b urglarized. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 649, 400 S.E.2d 794, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1515, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (1991). Since statutory burglary does not contain the element of an actual or threatened breach of the peace, common-law trespass is not a lesser included offense of stat utory burglary. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 649, 400 S.E.2d 794, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1515, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (1991).

This section is a lesser included offense of § 18.2-89, the principal distinction bei ng that under this section the crime intended upon entry is a non-theft misdemeanor rather than a felony.

App. LEXIS 346 (1994). Occupied construed.  The phrase while said dwelling is occupied in this section is not an element of the crime requiring the physical presence of the occupant at the time of t he unlawful entry. Rather, it is language intended by the legislature to emphasize the character of the use of the dwelling as a place of current habitation rather than a dwelling that is temporarily vacant. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 441, 444 S.E.2d 559, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1414, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 346 (1994). Evidence establishing both actual and constructive breaking and entering.  Where the prosecutrix in a case of breaking and entering with the intent to commit assault and battery testified that she opened her door only about one foot, and thus the defendant had to push the door open additionally in order to enter the apartment, and where she also stated that she expressly told the defendant to remain outside when she went to get him a glass of water, this testimony established both an ac tual and a constructive breaking and entering by the defendant. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 872, 275 S.E.2d 592, 1981 Va. LEXIS 222 (1981). Forcing vict im to open door is constructive breaking.  Given the lack of any qualifications, the phrase to gain entry in a jury instruction permitted the jury to find defendant guilty of burglary under § 18 .2-92 by way of a constructive breaking if defendant forced the victim to open a door no less than if defendant had forced the door open. Lay v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. App. 330, 649 S.E.2d 714, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 326 (2007). Evidence showing only that the defendant broke and entered an apartment as he fled from the police, entering from one side of the apartment and exiting on the other, was insufficient to show that he did this with intent to obstruct a law enforcement officer. Thomas v. Commonwealth, No. 0213-90-2 (Ct. of Appeals March 12, 1991). Defendants mere presence did not establish participation in the break-in; however, o ther circumstances surrounding his presence and his subsequent entry into the dwelling were sufficient to establish that he shared the criminal intent to break into the apartment. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 441, 444 S.E.2d 559, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1414, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 346 (1994). Intent inferred.  Required intent to commit some misdemeanor could be inferred by defendants participation either as the principal housebreaker or as a principal in the second degree to the breaking, and his subsequent entry into the home. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 441, 444 S.E.2d 559, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1414, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 346 (1994). Amending the indictment to change the intent.  Trial court did not err by amending the indictment, which charged breaking and entering with the intent to commit destruction of property, by adding the phrase or indecent exposure where: (1) the amendment permitted the Commonwealth to satisfy its burden of proof with either of two specific alternatives; (2) the modification of the original indictment did not change the general nature or character of th e crime charged; (3) only the intent changed, and as amended the indictment still charged a misdemeanor of the same general nature or class; (4) the amendment did not surprise defendant because the original indictment included a count that charged indece nt exposure; (5) the amendment did not prejudice defendant because the trial court continued the case after making the amendment; and (6) the trial court convicted defendant of the charge as originally stated. Esquibele v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEX IS 586 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 30, 2004). Evidence sufficient for breaking.  Evidence presented at trial was sufficient to show that defendant broke and entered the victims apartment. The evidence proved that defendant was present at t he scene of the break-in and that he was inside the victims apartment immediately following the break-in. Although victims testimony was not conclusive as to what door  the main door of the apartment building or the interior apartment door  she saw defendant push against, the trier of fact was privileged to weigh this evidence and determine whether or not defendant committed an act of breaking. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 441, 444 S.E.2d 559, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1414, 1994 Va. App . LEXIS 346 (1994). Evidence of deadly weapon sufficient.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of statutory burglary while armed with a deadly weapon under § 18.2-92 where it showed that defendant entered an a partment looking for his assailants, brandished gun at the occupants, and only left when satisfied his quarry was not present; the Commonwealth did not need to prove that the gun was operable or loaded for it to be a deadly weapon. Inge v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 85, 570 S.E.2d 869, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 617 (2002). No error in failure to instruct.  Where defendant made no effort to take any property or thing of value, reached for and tore the victims night clothes, and attempted to quiet her and get her to her bedroom, the trial judge did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that they could find the defendant guilty of burglary with the intent to commit a misdemeanor. Lea v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 300, 429 S.E.2d 477, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1288, 1993 Va . App. LEXIS 100 (1993). Evid ence insufficient to show intent to obstruct justice.  Evidence did not prove that defendants had the intent to obstruct justice when they entered apartment where evidence proved that the three men entered the apartme nt in an apparent attempt to avoid detection or to await the end of the disturbances in which they had been involved; no evidence proved that they had any contact with police officers before they entered the apartment or even that police officers were pr esent when they entered the apartment; and although the men peered through the windows, no facts or circumstances proved that the defendants intended by threat or force to attempt to intimidate or impede a law-enforcement officer. Dowdell v. Commonwealth , No. 1694-93-1 (Ct. of Appeals March 7, 1995). Review.  Because defendant did not argue, and neither party briefed the specific issues, the court of appeals decline to address his assignment of error as it was insuffic iently preserved; neither party addressed whether defendant intended to commit any misdemeanor except assault and battery or trespass, and thus, it was unclear whether he would have fulfilled the requirements for the crime with which he was charged, burg lary. Bethel v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 120 (Va. Ct. App. May 2, 2017). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Earned sentence credits.  The exclusion in subdivision A 17 e of § 53.1-202.3 does not apply to a second or subsequent violation of §§ 18.2-51 or 18.2-51.1 when the first violatio n was committed maliciously; and in subdivision A 17 g of § 53.1-202.3 would not apply when an offender violates § 18.2-92, but only previously violated § 18.2-90. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Harold W. Clarke, Director, Virg inia Department of Corrections, 21-068, 2021 Va. AG LEXIS 41 (12/21/21). A conviction for a second offense of § 18.2-51 or § 18.2-51.1 would not fall under the scope of § 53.1-202.3(A)(17)(e) where the first offense was com mitted maliciously. Likewise, a conviction for violating § 18.2-92, where the offender was only previously convicted of violating § 18.2-90, would not fall within the scope of § 53.1-202.3(A)(17)(g). As such, those convictions would be eligib le for enhanced earned sentence credits. See opinion of Attorney General to Harold W. Clarke, Director, Virginia Department of Corrections, No. 2022-008, 2022 VA.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3A M.J. Burglary and Housebreaking, § 5; 12A M.J. Larceny , § 2; 16 M.J. Robbery, §§ 3, 9. CASE NOTES Section recognizes robbery as crime against the person.  The enactment of this section clearly shows that it has never been the intention of the legislature to enlarge, decrease or change the common-law crime of robbery . Recognizing the doctrine that robbery is a crime against the person, and not against a house or other inanimate thing, the legislature passed this section. Falden v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 542, 189 S.E. 326, 1937 Va. LEXIS 294 (1937); Cox v. Commonwealt h, 218 Va. 689, 240 S.E.2d 524, 1978 Va. LEXIS 137 (1978). Property of another need not be taken.  A person convicted under this section need not have taken the personal property of another. Hill v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 683, 347 S.E.2d 913, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2 51, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 321 (1986). Banking house.  Technical distinctions in the definitions of bank and savings and loan association provided for regulatory purposes, and found in the banking and finance title of the Code, do not bar inclusion of both types of financial institutions within the general descriptive term banking house as used in this section. Black v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 186, 455 S.E.2d 755, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 357 (19 95). Expert improperly qualified.  In a prosecution for the use of a deadly weapon with the intent to commit larceny and the use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery, the trial court erred i n qualifying a detective as an expert in firearms, as the BB gun defendant used was clearly not a firearm. However, the error was harmless as the detective had the requisite knowledge to be classified as an expert on BB guns, and his improper cla ssification could have only had a slight effect on the jury, if any. Justiss v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 261, 734 S.E.2d 699, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 404 (2012). Experts opinion went to ultima te issue.  In prosecution for the use of a firearm with the intent to commit larceny, the trial court reversibly erred in allowing a detective to testify as an expert that t he BB gun defendant used was capable of causing serious injury or death, as this opinion went to the ultimate issue  whether the BB gun was a deadly weapon  and improperly invaded the province of the jury. Justiss v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 261, 734 S.E.2d 699, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 404 (2012). Evidence of deadly weapon sufficient.  Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction of entering a bank with a deadly weapon, because defendant displayed the object as an offensive weapo n, capable of inflicting death or great bodily injury, and the teller, who was familiar with guns, testified that she saw the handle part of the pistol. Davis v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 580 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 1, 2002). Because there was evidence that a BB gun could cause serious injury or death, even if the trial court had given defendants requested jury instructions, the ve rdict would have been the same; thus, defendant was properly convicted of entering a bank armed with a deadly weapon with the intent to commit larceny. Young v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 402 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 11, 2005). In prosecution for the use of a deadly weapon with the intent to commit larceny, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the BB gun defendant us ed while robbing a bank was a deadly weapon, including a detectives testimony that he knew of two incidents involving BB guns that resulted in either death or serious bodily injury. Justiss v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 261, 734 S.E.2d 699, 2012 Va. A pp. LEXIS 404 (2012). Pistol with wooden bullets h eld to be deadly.  Where the defendant entered the bank wielding a pistol in the ordinary manner contemplated by its nature and design and his brandishing of it held it out as an of fensive weapon, capable of inflicting death or great bodily injury, the mere fact that the wooden bullets therein were ab initio incapable of being discharged did not make the pistol any less deadly within the meaning of this section. Cox v. Commonwealth , 218 Va. 689, 240 S.E.2d 524, 1978 Va. LEXIS 137 (1978). Evidence of go od character of accused is admissible.  Evidence of the good character of the accused in a prosecution under this section should be admitted, not for the purpose of affecting his guilt or innocence, but for the effect it may have upon the degree of his punishment. The Commonwealth should also have the right to introduce evidence in rebuttal. Roach v. Commonwealth, 157 Va. 954, 162 S.E. 50, 1932 Va. LEXIS 335 (1932). Nolo contendere should not be accept ed.  A charge of entering a banking house while armed with a deadly weapon with intent to commit larceny is a charge of a felony. Under the law prevailing in Virginia a plea of nolo contendere cannot be accepted in a felony case, and in a prosecution under this section the court errs in receiving the plea. Roach v. Commonwealth, 157 Va. 954, 162 S.E. 50, 1932 Va. LEXIS 335 (1932). Convictions under this section and § 18.2-53.1 not double jeopardy.  In order to prove the offense pursuant to this section, the commonwealth must establish that the defendant entered a bank while armed with a deadly weapon but evi dence of use or display of the weapon is not an element of this crime as it is under § 18.2-53.1 and, therefore, convicting a defendant both for use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery and for entry into a banking house while armed with a dead ly weapon does not violate the double jeopardy clause. Collins v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 27, 2001). Convictions under this section and § 18.2-58 not double jeopardy.  Convictions for both robbery and entry of a banking house with the intent to commit larceny while armed with a deadly weapon did not violate the double jeopardy c lause. Hill v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 683, 347 S.E.2d 913, 3 Va. Law Rep. 251, 1986 Va.

For related discussion, see 3A M.J. Burglary &amp; Housebreaking, §§ 6.1, 16. CASE NOTES The presumption of criminal intent does not attach to all tools, implements, or outfits embraced by the statute but only to such offending articles innately burglarious in character, those commonly used by burglars in house breaking and safe cracking, particularly suitable and appropriate to accomplish the destruction of any ordinary hind rance of access to any building, vault or safe. Hagy v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 152, 543 S.E.2d 614, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 153 (2001). Statute requires proof that tools, implements or outfit were intrinsically burglarious only when the Commonwealth relies upon the statutory presumption to establish the requisite criminal intent. Moss v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 1, 509 S.E.2d 510, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 33 (1999). Plastic bag not an implement.  As an ordinary plastic bag is not an implement as proscribed by § 18.2-94 because it serves no particular purpose in furtherance of a trade, occupation , profession, or work, defendants conviction for possession of burglarious tools was reversed. Williams v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. App. 337, 649 S.E.2d 717, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 333 (2007). Mere possession of burglarious tools is not a crime.  The mere possession of burglarious tools is not a crime under the statute. It is possession with intent to use them to commit a crime. The tools or implements may be, and usually are, designed and manufactured for lawful purposes. Burnette v. Commonwealth, 194 Va. 785, 75 S.E.2d 482, 1953 Va. LEXIS 147 (1953). The mere possession of burglarious tools, without more, is not in itself considered a crime under this section. Richards v. Cox, 303 F. Supp. 946, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10367 (W.D. Va. 1969). Mere possession of burglarious tools is not a crime, for such may be, and usually are, designed and manufactured for lawful purposes; the gravamen of the offense arises from the possessors intent to use these common, ordinary objects for a criminal purpose specified by statute, namely, burglary, robbery or larceny. Blaney v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 3, 2001). This section does not require that burglarious tools actually be used in the burglary, o nly that they be possessed with intent to commit burglary. Watkins v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 335, 494 S.E.2d 859, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 23 (1998). All the last sentence of this section does is to create a presumption of a criminal intent from proof of possession of burglarious tools or implements. Such a presumption is not conclusive; it cuts off no defense. It interposes no obstacle to a contest of all the issues of fact, and relieves neither the court nor the jury of the duty to determine all of the questions of fact from the weight of the whole evidence. It is merely a rule of evidence and not the determination of a fact. Burnette v. Commonwealth, 194 Va. 785, 75 S.E.2d 482, 1953 Va. LEXIS 147 (1953); Nance v. Commonwealth, 20 3 Va. 428, 124 S.E.2d 900, 1962 Va. LEXIS 163 (1962). Possession creates only a prima facie presumption of the criminal intent of the accused which is not conclusive. Richards v. Cox, 303 F. Supp. 946, 1969 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 10367 (W.D. Va. 1969). And such sentence is constitutional.  The last sentence of this section is not unconstitutional as making the mere possession of common ordinary tools of a trade or calling prima facie evidence of int ent to commit a crime. The word such, as used in the last sentence, does not refer to the phrase any tools, etc., used in the preceding sentence, and viewing the history and purpose of this section a proper construction requires the word such to be ignored and deleted. Thus construed the statute makes the meaning of the last sentence clear and consistent with the legislative intent to adopt a rule of evidence making possession of only burglarious tools (by one other than a licens ed dealer) prima facie evidence of intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny. Burnette v. Commonwealth, 194 Va. 785, 75 S.E.2d 482, 1953 Va. LEXIS 147 (1953). The test of the constitutionality of a statute making proof of a certain fact presumptive evidence of another fact is whether there is a natural and rational evid entiary relation between the fact proven and the ultimate fact presumed. The last sentence of this section, making possession of burglarious tools prima facie evidence of intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny meets this test. Burnette v. Commonwe alth, 194 Va. 785, 75 S.E.2d 482, 1953 Va. LEXIS 147 (1953). This section couples possession of tools with the intent to commit a crime. Richards v. Cox, 303 F. Supp. 946, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10367 (W.D. Va. 1969). State must prove tools were under control of accused.  It is incumbent upon the Commonwealth to prove that the tools were under the control of the accused. Richards v. Cox, 303 F. Supp. 946, 1969 U.S. Dist. LE XIS 10367 (W.D. Va. 1969). Pair of pants can constitute outfit as that term is used in this section. Mercer v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 380, 512 S.E.2d 173, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (1999), limited, Edwards v. Commonwealth, 52 Va. App. 70, 661 S.E.2d 488, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (2008), overruled in part, Edwards v. Commonwealth, 53 Va. App. 402, 672 S.E.2d 8 94, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 160 (2009). Burden of proof on showi ng pant wearing intent.  Because a pair of pants is not necessarily burglarious, that is, it is not an item commonly used to break into a structure, to convict defendant under Vir ginias burglary statute, the Commonwealth was required to prove that defendant possessed these pants with the intent to use them to commit larceny. Mercer v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 380, 512 S.E.2d 173, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (1999), limited, Edw ards v. Commonwealth, 52 Va. App. 70, 661 S.E.2d 488, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (2008), overruled in part, Edwards v. Commonwealth, 53 Va. App. 402, 672 S.E.2d 894, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 160 (2009) (overruled to the extent that it defines outfit as wearing apparel). Outfit not limited to wear ing apparel.  The Court of Appeals of Virginia overrules Mercer v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 380, 512 S.E.2d, 173 (1999) to the extent that it defines outfit as wearing apparel, and holds that, in the context of § 18.2-94, the appropriate definition of outf it is the articles forming equipment or the tools or instruments comprised in any special equipment; as a carpenters or a surgeons outfit. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 53 Va. App. 402, 672 S.E.2d 894, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 160 (2009). Burden of making reasonable explanation is shifted to defendant.  When a person, other than a licensed dealer, has been shown to have in his possession burglarious tools, the burden of making a reasonable explanation to overcome the statutory presumption is shifted to him,  an explanation sufficiently credible to be accepted by a jury. Nance v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 428, 124 S.E.2d 900, 1962 Va. LEXIS 163 (1962). Once possession is proven, the burden of going forward with the evidence shifts to the defendant, but this does not shift the burden of ultimate proof, or deprive defendant of his right to have the jury instructed on the presumption of innocence. Richards v. Cox, 303 F. Supp. 946, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10367 (W.D. Va. 1969). Upon proof that one not a licensed dealer is in possession of burglarious tools, the Commonwealth is entitled to a presumption on intent, shifting the bur den to the defendant to explain the possession. However, the Commonwealth is free to prove its case without the benefit of the presumption. Carter v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 528, 290 S.E.2d 865, 1982 Va. LEXIS 235 (1982). Instruction held proper.  An instruction to the jury in the words of the last sentence of this section was proper where the evidence showed possession of burglarious tools. Nance v. Common wealth, 203 Va. 428, 124 S.E.2d 900, 1962 Va. LEXIS 163 (1962). Vending machine keys were tools.  Where defendant admitted that he wrongfully gained possession of vending machine keys and thereafter employed them to open several vending machines and steal coin s, he clearly possessed and used the keys, tools embraced by this section, with an intent to commit larceny, a violation of the statute. Moss v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 1, 509 S.E.2d 510, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 33 (1999). Sufficiency of evidence.  In prosecution under this section where evidence showed that burglarious tools were found in a car in which defendant was riding with another man, conviction was reversed because Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had actual or constructive possession and control of them. Burnette v. Commonwealth, 194 Va. 785, 75 S.E.2d 482, 1953 Va. LEXIS 147 (1953).

The legislature may chang e them, and it might entirely abolish such distinctions. Bell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 526, 189 S.E. 441, 1937 Va. LEXIS 293 (1937). Robbery, burglary, grand larceny and abduction, are each treated separately and are gove rned by a separate statutory provision. Austin v. Peyton, 279 F. Supp. 227, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8969 (W.D. Va. 1968). Larceny has often been defined as the wrongful or fraudulent taking of personal goods of some intrinsic value, belonging to another, without his assent, and with the intention to deprive the owner thereof permanently. Skeeter v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 722, 232 S.E.2d 756, 1977 Va. LEXIS 228 (1977). Larceny is the wrongful or fraudulent taking of personal goods belonging to another without his consent and with the intention to deprive the owner thereof perman ently. Berryman v. Moore, 619 F. Supp. 853, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15084 (E.D. Va. 1985), dismissed without op., 792 F.2d 139, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 18658 (4th Cir. 1986). Larceny, robbery distinguish ed.  If appellant killed victim intending to steal his property, the theft was robbery. If appellant killed victim only for a purpose unrelated to theft, and as an aft er thought decided to steal his property, the theft was larceny. Shepperson v. Commonwealth, 19 Va. App. 586, 454 S.E.2d 5, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 98 (1995). For theft by violence or intimidation to constitute robbery, the intent to steal must exist at the time of the violence or intimidation. Shepperson v. Commonwealt h, 19 Va. App. 586, 454 S.E.2d 5, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 98 (1995). Trial court erred in reducing the robbery charge in the indictment against defendant to grand larceny because grand larceny was not a lesser included offense of r obbery, as all the elements of grand larceny were not included in robbery. However, petit larceny was a lesser-included offense of robbery because all of the elements of petit larceny were contained in robbery. Dufresne v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEX IS 38 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 9, 2016), different results reached on reh'g, 66 Va. App. 644, 791 S.E.2d 335, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 267 (2016). Larceny, embezzlem ent distinguished.  Embezzlement and larceny are separate offenses with different elements. The key distinction between embezzlement and larceny is that larceny involves a trespassor y taking of property while embezzlement involves a conversion of property received with the owners consent. Cera v. Commonwealth, No. 0432-94-4 (Ct. of Appeals May 2, 1995). Larceny and embezzlement are not the same offense for determining time limits under § 19.2-243. Cera v. Commonwealth, No. 0432-94-4 (Ct. of Appeals May 2, 199 5). Under Virginia law, embezzlement, false pretenses, and larceny are three separate offenses, and there is not a general theft statute, as there is in most states, that encompasses both types of behavior; § 18.2-95 defines grand larceny; § 18.2-111 defines embezzlement; and § 18.2-178 defines false pretenses. The Commonwealth of Virginia has always purported to treat the three basic theft crimes of larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses as separate and distinct offenses, and maintains separate statutes for each crime. United States v. Good, 326 F.3d 589, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 7543 (4th Cir. 2003). Grand larceny.  Under this section, grand larceny includes the taking, not from the person of another, of goods that have a value of $200 or more. Tarpley v. Commonwealth, 261 Va . 251, 542 S.E.2d 761, 2001 Va. LEXIS 31 (2001). The concept of larceny from the person recognizes an enhanced societal concern for condu ct that implicates at least a potential for personal assault, conduct that involves the person of the victim and jeopardizes his personal security. Garland v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 706, 446 S.E.2d 628, 11 Va. Law Rep. 65, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 507 (199 4). Larceny by receiving stolen goods is a lesser offense which is included in the major one of larceny, and the lesser offense is indictable as larceny, and the accused may be convicted of the lesser offense of receiving stolen goods. Cabbler v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 520, 184 S.E.2d 781, 1971 Va. LEXIS 384 (1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1073, 92 S. Ct. 1501, 31 L. Ed. 2d 807, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 3011 (1972). The crime of receiving stolen goods is a lesser offense included in the crime of larceny. Henderson v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 811, 213 S.E.2d 782, 1975 Va. LEXIS 2 31 (1975). Larceny by receiving stole n goods.  Although the trial court erred by convicting defendant of violating § 18.2-95, instead of § 18.2-108, after the jury found defendant guilty of grand larceny by receiving stolen property, the trial courts failure to include a reference to § 18.2-108 in its final order was a clerical error that did not require reversal. Bazemore v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 291 (Va. Ct. App. May 13, 2003), op. withdrawn in part, vacated, No. 0103-02-1, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 9 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 13, 2004). Because larceny is a continuing offense, anyone who knows that personal property is stolen and assists in its transportation or disposition is guilty of larceny. Moehring v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 564, 290 S.E.2d 891, 1982 Va. LEXIS 239 (1982). Aiding and abetting grand larceny.  Evidence showed that defendant aided and abetted in attempted grand larceny because, while the perpetrator attempted to gain entry into the victims apartment, defendant waited a short distance away, entered the apartment when summoned by the perpetrator, exited the apartment when the police arrived, and knocked on the door of another apartment. Defendants knowledge of the perpetrators criminal intent, failure to discourage completion of the crime, and subsequent attempt to conceal defendants involvement in the crime was thus shown. Kersey v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 349 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 24, 2015). Lesser included offenses.  Trial court erred by reducing the felony grand larceny charge to misdemeanor interference with the property rights of another, because the latter was not a lesser -included offense of grand larceny since a violation of the misdemeanor statute focused on interference while a violation of the grand larceny statute focused on good and chattels over $200. Jones v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 244 (Va. Ct. App. Oc t. 3, 2017).

For related discussion, see 3A M.J. Banks and Banking, § 89; 12A M.J. Larceny, § 2 . CASE NOTES Larceny defined.  Larceny is the wrongful taking of the goods of another without the owners consent and with the intention to permanently deprive the owner of possession of the goods. Bright v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 248, 356 S.E.2d 443, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2595, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (1987). Larceny that was a misdemeanor was a petit larceny, there were no other possibilities for other larcenies within the context of § 18.2-181. Since § 18.2-96 had no impact upon the foregoing analysis, the one year statute of limitations under § 19.2-8, which applied to misdemeanors, did not apply to defendants act of passing a bad check for $140.88. Foster v. Commonwealth, 271 Va. 235, 623 S.E.2d 902, 2006 Va. LEXIS 6 (2006). The term felonious is not used in this section in defining petit larceny, and a charge in a warrant that the accused did unlawfully take, steal and carry away the property of another distinguishes the offense from a mere trespass, and stamps it as petit larceny. The definition of Webster and other lexicographers of the verb to s teal is to take and carry away feloniously; the words steal and larceny are synonymous. Satterfield v. Commonwealth, 105 Va. 867, 52 S.E. 979, 1906 Va. LEXIS 94 (1906). This section does not require proof of any minimum value. Evans v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 292, 308 S.E.2d 126, 1983 Va. LEXIS 318 (1983). Proof that an article has some value is sufficient to warrant a conviction of petit larceny, but where the value of the thing stolen determines the grade of the o ffense, the value must be alleged and the Commonwealth must prove the value to be the statutory amount. Owen v. Commonwealth, No. 1495-95-2 (Ct. of Appeals May 28, 1996). Allowance for depreciation.  While the original purchase price of an item may be admitted as evidence of its current value, there must also be due allowance for elements of depreciation.  Owen v. Commonwealth, No. 1495-95-2 (Ct. of Appeals May 28, 1996). No proof need be adduced to show that the subject of petit larceny has a specific value. Evans v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 292, 308 S.E.2d 126, 1983 Va. LEXIS 318 (1983). Larceny by receiving stolen goods is a lesser offense which is included in the major one of larceny, and the lesser offense is indictable as larceny, and the accused may be convicted of the lesser offense of receiving stolen goods. Cabbler v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 520, 184 S.E.2d 781, 1971 Va. LEXIS 384 (1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1073, 92 S. Ct. 1501, 31 L. Ed. 2d 807, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 3011 (1972). The crime of receiving stolen goods is a lesser offense included in the crime of larceny. Henderson v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 811, 213 S.E.2d 782, 1975 Va. LEXIS 2 31 (1975). When larceny is lesser-included offense of robbery.  Where defendant was charged initially with robbery for stealing a bicycle from an 11-year-old victim, and where the trial court, in acquitting defendant of that r obbery charge, noted its belief that the evidence was sufficient to convict him of larceny from the person but did not convict him of any larceny offense, the court thereby acquitted defendant of any larceny offense that was a part of the robbery charge, and the Commonwealth was thereafter barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause from requiring him to stand trial anew for stealing the same bicycle from the same person in the same criminal act that was the basis of the robbery trial. Therefore, the trial cou rt erred in denying defendants motion to dismiss the indictment as violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Hudgins v. Commonwealth, 43 Va. App. 219, 597 S.E.2d 221, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 264 (2004), revd, remanded, 269 Va. 209, 608 S.E.2d 907 (200 5), as to issue of impeachment questions asked during cross-examination. Larceny and venue considerations.  Even though larceny is a continuing offense and the offense of receiving stolen property is deemed larceny, an accused who receives stolen property knowing it to be stolen may be tried only in those jurisdictions in which the accused is guilty of trespassing against the owners property right. That offense can only occur in the place where the accused received the property or possessed it. The fiction of larce ny as a continuing offense does not create venue where the offense for which the accused is prosecuted occurred outside the jurisdiction of the trial court. Davis v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 709, 419 S.E.2d 285, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3545, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 171 (1992). The information contained in the warrant provided the defendant with sufficient notice o f the charged crime, even in the absence of a clear indication of who owned the picture. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the defendants motion to dismiss on grounds that the warrant was fatally defective in not naming the owner of t he picture. Humphreys v. Commonwealth, No. 1324-95-4 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 11, 1997). Probable cause for purposes of stores right to detain suspected shoplifter.  Store was immune from liability under § 8.01-226.9 in a customers false imprisonment and malicious prosecution action, and therefore it was entitled to sum mary judgment, because it had probable cause to detain customer for committing petit larceny in violation of § 18.2-96 after she attempted to leave the store with a TV and VCR for which she had no receipt. At the time the stores employees detained the customer, they knew that: (1) she had received full credit on her mothers credit card for the returned merchandise; (2) she did not pay for the new television and VCR; (3) she had stood close to her friend while the friend shoplifted twice in th e store; and (4) the customer attempted to leave the store with the TV and VCR without a receipt proving that she had paid for them. Jones v. Target Corp., 341 F. Supp. 2d 583, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21425 (E.D. Va. 2004). Where defendant was found in possession of property of a type recently stolen, it was no t necessary for the goods to have been identified by serial number or with further precision than appeared from the record. Wright v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 743, 348 S.E.2d 9, 3 Va. Law Rep. 326, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 326 (1986). Unexplained possession of stolen goods permits inference of larceny by possessor.  Once the crime of larceny is established, the unexplained possession of recently stolen goods permits an inference of larceny by the possessor. Bright v. Commonwe alth, 4 Va. App. 248, 356 S.E.2d 443, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2595, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (1987). Defendants recent exclusive possession of stolen handgun and his conflicting or false explanation as to where he obtained it supported finding of his guilt as to petit larceny. Bright v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 248, 356 S.E.2d 443, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2595, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (1987). Defendants conviction for petit and grand larceny was supported by sufficient evidence where: (1) the items found in the rear cargo area of the car driven by defendant at the time of a traffic stop had been recently stolen from vehicles parked on a body shop lot; (2) the jury was not required to accept defendants explanation that he was legitimately present on the lot and that either his brother or co-def endant could have placed the stolen items in the cargo compartment, unbeknownst to him; (3) there was a discrepancy between defendants statement to a police officer as to the time defendant was on the property and the time a security officer saw defe ndants car leaving a body shop lot; (4) defendant drove from the lot in a rapid manner; and (5) the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendants denial of knowledge of the presence of the stolen goods in the car and his explanation to the police officer were not credible. Sbitan v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 19 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 17, 2006). There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of petit larceny because the trial court could reasonably infer he was consciously asserting at least a possess ory interest in ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-97"><akn:num>§ 18.2-97</akn:num><akn:heading>Larceny of certain animals and poultry</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Any person who shall be guilty of the larceny of a dog, horse, pony, mule, cow, steer, bull, or calf shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony, and any person who shall be gu ilty of the larceny of any poultry of the value of $5 or more, but of the value of less than $1,000, or of a sheep, lamb, swine, or goat, of the value of less than $1,000, shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.

It is of no moment that a appears before the names of the animals embraced in th is section, for it has been held that the article does not necessarily denote the singular. Wolfe v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 486, 189 S.E. 320, 1937 Va. LEXIS 292 (1937) (see § 1-13.15). Sufficiency of evidence.  Where no one witnessed the alleged crime of larceny of a dog, and the dogs owner testified that his dogs ran loose all the time, there was no evidence to prov e that the defendant took and carried away the dog; the defendants possession of the missing dog nine months later was insufficient evidence to establish larceny where the defendant explained that he traded dogs with another person in the spring, a f act which was corroborated by the Commonwealths evidence. Hall v. Commonwealth, No. 0473-86-3 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 26, 1987). § 18.2-97.1. Removal of a transmitting device; penalty. Text Any person who removes an electronic or radio transmitting device from a dog, falcon, hawk, or owl without the permission of the owner and with the intent to prevent or hinder the owner from locating the dog, falcon, hawk, or owl is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Upon a finding of guilt, the court shall order that the defendant pay as restitution the actual value of any dog, falcon, hawk, or owl lost or killed as a r esult of such removal.

Indi ctment should charge paper is property of some person.  If an indictment for stealing bank notes does not charge that they are the bank notes of, or belong to, some named person or persons, or some person to the jurors unknown, the defect is fatal, and is not cured by the statute of jeofails. Barker v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 122 (1817). It should describe paper.  An indictment charging the prisoner with stealing certain papers of the value of $110, without further description of the papers, is fatally defective. Robinson v . Commonwealth, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 866 (1879). Amount of note is taken as value.  In an indictment for stealing bank notes, it is sufficient to state that the notes were for a certain sum of money, without stating their value. Adams v. Commonwe alth, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 949, 1873 Va. LEXIS 82 (1873). Face value of money is its value.  The indictment here properly charged grand larceny in that it alleged the money stolen to be $590. Since money was the subject of the larceny its face value is it s value. Wright v. Commonwealth, 196 Va. 132, 82 S.E.2d 603, 1954 Va. LEXIS 208 (1954). The last sentence of this section merely prescribes a rule for estimating the value of t he paper, and is not a part of the necessary description of the offense prescribed by the preceding sections, although the words remaining unsatisfied are usually inserted in the indictment in such cases. Whalen v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 544, 19 S. E. 182, 1894 Va. LEXIS 20 (1894). Value of paper is not traversable.  In an indictment for stealing bank notes, it is sufficient to state that the notes were for a certain sum of money, without stating their value, under this sectio n. In such a case, since the passage of this section, the value of the bank notes is not traversable. Adams v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 949, 1873 Va. LEXIS 82 (1873). And no proof of value is necessary.  Pursuant to this section, no proof of the value of a stolen check was necessary, as the law deems it to be of the value expressed on its face. Whalen v. Commonwea lth, 90 Va. 544, 19 S.E. 182, 1894 Va. LEXIS 20 (1894). Enhancing punishment.  Stealing a check, in violation of this section, is like concealing merchandise in violation of § 18.2-103 for purposes of enhancing punishment under § 18.2-104, and is an offense deemed to be larceny for purposes of enhancing punishment under former § 19.2-297. Stamps v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 862, 407 S.E.2d 337, 8 Va. Law Rep. 243, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 164 (1991). Amendment of indictment.  Defendants conviction of grand larceny under § 18.2-95 was not improper based on an alleged amendment of the indictment during his trial from § 18.2-95 to § 18.2-98 because while the amendment was granted, the indictment was not actually amended. Lucas v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 181 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 21, 2009). Sufficient averment of property.  An indictment which charged a larceny of bank notes of the value, etc., of the money, goods and chattels of one G.F. and from the said G.F. is a sufficien t averment of property in the notes in G.F., the person from whom they were stolen, after verdict; for the words the money, goods and chattels of may be rejected as surplusage. Commonwealth v. Moseley, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 154 (1819). Evidence held sufficient to prove defendant was guilty of grand larceny.  Facts supported a reasonable inference by the trier of fact that defendant had both the opportunity and the means to obtain all of the checks and that he knew his possession of employees check was wrongful, therefore, Commonwealth met its burden to establish guilt of grand larceny beyond a reasonable doubt. Hubbard v. Commonwealth, No. 2111-92-3 (Ct. of Appeals May 10, 1994). Because defendant took a check that was payable to her husband, endorsed his name to the check, and deposited it to her personal account without permission or pur suant to a good faith claim of right, she was properly convicted of grand larceny and uttering under §§ 18.2-98 and 18.2-172.

CASE NOTES Motion to strike multiple indictments under the single larceny doctrine.  Trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to strike three of the four grand larceny indictments against defendant, under the single larceny doctrin e, because defendants criminal act of telling a logger to cut down trees on the property that defendant rented, without the owners permission, constituted four larcenous acts, which defendant committed over eight days.

CASE NOTES Elements of offense.  Under this section, a conviction of unauthorized use of a vehicle requires proof of use without the consent of the owner with intent temporarily to deprive the ow ner of possession, without intent to steal, or proof of assistance in such use. Reese v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 172, 335 S.E.2d 266, 1985 Va. LEXIS 265 (1985). Violation when s cope of permitted taking exceeded.  Where an act violates the specific scope or duration of consent to use a vehicle, a trespassory taking contemplated by this section occurs. This is not to say tha t in every instance where a person is in possession of property with the owners consent, an unanticipated use constitutes a trespass. The focus is strictly on acts that violate the owners express limitations of the scope or duration of the consen t given. Overstreet v. Commonwealth, 17 Va. App. 234, 435 S.E.2d 906, 10 Va. Law Rep. 389, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 510 (1993). Where the owner gives consent to a temporary possession or a possession for a limited purpose, the expiration of that qualification creates a constructive revestm ent of possession in the true owner with bare charge or custody in the other person. A violation of this possessory right constitutes a trespassory taking. Overstreet v. Commonwealth, 17 Va. App. 234, 435 S.E.2d 906, 10 Va. Law Rep. 389, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 510 (1993). Where owner had given defendant permission to use his automobile on the express condition that the car be returned by 3:00 a.m. on April 8, and defendant retained possession of the car until 11:30 p.m. on April 8, a prima facie case of unauthorized use was established since the evidence shows that the borrowers use of the vehicle exceeded the scope and duration of the owners consent. Eley v. Commonwealth, No. 2526-95-1 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 11, 1997). Conviction for the unauthorized use of a motor vehicle was not a theft offense under 8 U.S.C.S. § 1101(a)(43)(G) because the unauthorized use statute applied t o even de minimis deprivations of ownership interests and circumstances typically viewed as glorified borrowing, which were not included in the definition of a theft offense by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Castillo v. Holder, 776 F.3d 262, 2 015 U.S. App. LEXIS 559 (4th Cir. 2015). Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle because it allowed the fact finder to conclude that a vehicle owners consent to let defendant possess the vehicle to fix the brakes did not extend to allowing defendant to use the vehicle to tow his own vehicle; defendant admitted that he intended to use the owners vehicle to tow his own vehicle. Otey v. C ommonwealth, 71 Va. App. 792, 839 S.E.2d 921, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (2020). The main difference between larceny and the statutory offense of unauthorized use of a m otor vehicle is that in the former there must be an intent to deprive the owner of his property permanently, while in the latter the intent is to deprive the owner of possession of his automobile temporarily and without any intent to steal the same. The intent with which property is taken determines the offense. Slater v. Commonwealth, 179 Va. 264, 18 S.E.2d 909, 1942 Va. LEXIS 218 (1942); Robinson v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 134, 56 S.E.2d 367, 1949 Va. LEXIS 268 (1949); Travelers Indem. Co. v. Ford, 208 Va. 151, 156 S.E.2d 606, 1967 Va. LEXIS 198 (1967); Comer v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 246, 176 S.E.2d 432, 1970 Va. LEXIS 241 (1970). The taking of a car, unaccompanied by an intent permanently to deprive the owner of the car, is a crime separate from the crime of larceny. A taking without the r equisite intent is not within the coverage of a theft insurance policy. Travelers Indem. Co. v. Ford, 208 Va. 151, 156 S.E.2d 606, 1967 Va. LEXIS 198 (1967). Intent alone distinguishes larceny of a vehicle from unauthorized use. Hewitt v. Commonwe alth, 213 Va. 605, 194 S.E.2d 893, 1973 Va. LEXIS 193 (1973). Permissive use may develop into unauthorized use where the borrowers acts exceed the scope or duration of the owners consent to use his or her vehicle. Eley v. Commonwealth, No. 2526-95-1 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 11, 1997). Where, as here, an owner gives another consent to temporary possession for a limited time, the expiration of that qualification extinguishes the borrowers rig htful possession. Continued possession by the borrower is a violation of the owners possessory right and constitutes a trespassory taking. Eley v. Commonwealth, No. 2526-95-1 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 11, 1997). No theft if return intended.  Under the terms of an automobile insurance policy, in order to constitute a theft there must be present an intent permanently to deprive the owner of the vehicle. If it is shown that the alleged thief intended to return the vehicle after using it temporarily, there is no theft. Travelers Indem. Co. v. Ford, 208 Va. 151, 156 S.E.2d 606, 1967 Va. LEXIS 198 (1967). The intent temporarily to deprive the owner of his property is an essential element of this offense and that intent is just as necessary to be proved as the act itself. Blanks v. Gordon, 202 Va. 295, 117 S.E.2d 82, 1960 Va. LEXIS 221 (1960). Taking without intent to steal.  If defendant did unlawfully take the automobile of another, without the consent of the owner and in his absence, and with the intent to temporarily deprive the ow ner of his possession, but without intent to steal said vehicle, the crime is complete under this section. United States v. Schuster, 220 F. Supp. 61, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7359 (E.D. Va. 1963). Unauthorized use is a lesser offense included under larceny. Hewitt v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 605, 194 S.E.2d 893, 1973 Va. LEXIS 193 (1973). Where defendant argued that the evidence did not show he only intended to temporarily deprive the owner of the use of his car, rather, any intent shown was that h e had intended to deprive permanently the owner of his car, and therefore, the evidence was insufficient to show unauthorized taking, such argument had little or no validity in view of the supreme courts decision that unauthorized use is a lesser inc luded offense of larceny. United States v. Garcia, 868 F.2d 114, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 1823 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1094, 109 S. Ct. 2439, 104 L. Ed. 2d 995, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 2621 (1989). Unauthorized use is a lesson.  Where the defendant was found in exclusive possession of the recently stolen vehicle, the evidence was sufficient to find he was driving a stolen car and to exclu de every reasonable hypothesis that he drove a different car. Montague v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 430, 579 S.E.2d 667, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 289 (2003). Taking and abandonment const itute larceny.  Accused, who did not have the consent of the owner to take his car, testified that he had no intention of stealing the car though he never intended to return it b ut intended to abandon it in a neighboring town. It was held that he was guilty of larceny. Slater v. Commonwealth, 179 Va. 264, 18 S.E.2d 909, 1942 Va. LEXIS 218 (1942). In Reese v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 172, 335 S.E.2d 266 (1985), the court held that the circumstances under which the car was taken, and accuseds actions regard ing it afterwards, including his abandoning it in a public highway, showed clearly that he was guilty of the offense of larceny and not of unauthorized use . Defendant properly convicted of using wifes car without consent.  Defendant was properly convicted of destroying and using without consent a car that was not his own, in violation of §§ 18.2-137 and 18.2-102, respe ctively, because hi...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-103"><akn:num>§ 18.2-103</akn:num><akn:heading>Concealing or taking possession of merchandise; altering price tags; transferring goods from one container to another; counseling, etc</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>, another in performance of such acts.

CASE NOTES To convict an accused for unlawful concealment in violation of this section, the commonw ealth must prove a willful concealment of merchandise done with the intent to convert the merchandise or to defraud the storekeeper. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 134, 543 S.E.2d 605, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 133 (2001). Goods.  Goods includes not only merchandise offered for sale but also any other items of tangible personal property belonging to a merchant; the Virginia Legislat ure intended to proscribe the concealment of both merchandise offered for sale and other types of goods not offered for sale. Hulcher v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 601, 575 S.E.2d 579, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 33 (2003). Concealment must be willful.  This section does not prohibit simply the concealment of merchandise; it prohibits a willful concealment and the word willful when used in a crimi nal statute generally means an act done with a bad purpose, without justifiable excuse, stubbornly, obstinately, perversely or without ground for believing it is lawful. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 134, 543 S.E.2d 605, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 133 (2 001). Concealment while still on premises.  The willful concealment of goods while still on the premises is prima facie evidence of intent to defraud the owner of the value of the goods or merchandise at is sue. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 134, 543 S.E.2d 605, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 133 (2001). Concealment on the person not requir ed.  The plain language of this section does not require proof of concealment on the person; concealment in another area of the store may thus constitue a violation of the statute if done willfully. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 134, 543 S.E.2d 605, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 133 (2001). Evidence of probation violation properly admitted to prove concealment.  During defendants trial for third offense petit larceny under §§ 18.2-103 and 18.2-104, the circuit court properly admitted into evidence an order findi ng defendant had previously violated probation to prove she committed the predicate offense of concealment. Defendant was not unfairly prejudiced by the admission of the order, even though it mentioned a prior conviction for drug distribution, because th e record showed that the circuit court did not consider the evidence regarding drug distribution, as the law presumed; rather, the circuit court convicted defendant based on its consideration of the credibility of the witnesses, not defendants histor y with law enforcement. Thornley v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 273 (Va. Ct. App. June 10, 2008). Evid ence of value of items stolen was improperly admitted.  Defendants felony shoplifting conviction was reversed because the admission of evidence of the value of the items defendant stole violated defendants righ t to confrontation, as (1) a handwritten list of the items and the items value, and a subsequent voided store receipt created from the list, were testimonial, as the list and receipt were created to prove the items value to show defendant committ ed felony, rather than misdemeanor, shoplifting, (2) the author and declarant of the handwritten list and the store receipt did not testify, nor was the author subject to cross-examination, (3) a testifying supervisor admitted the supervisor did not veri fy that the list stated each stolen items correct quantity and price, and (4) these exhibits were the only evidence of the items taken and the items value. Robertson v. Commonwealth, 60 Va. App. 688, 732 S.E.2d 30, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 297 (2012), different results reached on reh'g, 61 Va. App. 554, 738 S.E.2d 531, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 97 (2013). Improperly admitting evidence of value of items stolen was not harmless.  In a felony shoplifting prosecution, the erroneous admission of a handwritten list and a voided store receipt to prove the value of the items stolen was not harml ess because (1) admitting the voided receipt did not cure admitting the handwritten list, since the receipt was based on the list, and (2) these exhibits, which had the same constitutional defect, were the only evidence of the value of what defendant sto le. Robertson v. Commonwealth, 60 Va. App. 688, 732 S.E.2d 30, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 297 (2012), different results reached on reh'g, 61 Va. App. 554, 738 S.E.2d 531, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 97 (2013). Evidence supported willful conce alment.  Defendants conviction for petit larceny, third offense, in violation of § 18.2-103 was appropriate because the evidence showed that he had willfully concea led merchandise while on the stores premises, thus creating a prima facie case of an intent to steal and defraud the owner. A deputy testified that a store employee indicated to him that she suspected defendant of shoplifting and because there was no objection to that testimony, the trial court was free to consider it as evidence. Talley v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 441 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2010). Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for shoplifting because defendant acted willfully when he placed a television out of sight by purchasing a storage container and placing it over the television box in an attempt to get the television out of the store. Moreover, when he was approached by loss prevention, defendant ran out of the store and abandoned the items, despite the fact that he said he was goin g to pay. Vaughan v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 75 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 14, 2017). Sufficient evidence supporte d conviction.  Defendants conviction for felony shoplifting was supported by sufficient evidence that the value of the merchandise was at least $200, the minimum required by § 18.2-103, as the admission of exhibits listing the items shoplifted, their prices, and an adding machine tape adding the prices together, and a voided receipt did not violate the Confrontation Clause, U.S. Const. amend. VI, since the exhibits were jointly prepared by a store manager and an employee, under the managers supervision and direction, and the manager testified at trial about the preparation of the exhibits. Robertson v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 554, 738 S.E.2d 531, 2013 Va. App. LEX IS 97 (2013). Defendants conviction for grand larceny was appropriate because a loss prevention incident report was properly admitted into evidence and additionally, the ev idence presented at trial, including the report, was sufficient. Even if every item was discounted the total value was more than $200. Walker v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 186 (Va. Ct. App. June 18, 2013). Evidence supported the trial courts finding that defendant committed the crime of concealment under two theories, by removing the tank bag from the packaging, taking it to the restroom, and failing to return it to the box or the reshop cart before leaving the store and by hiding the tank bag somewhere on his person and fleeing with it and disposing of it when out of the officers sight. Cunningham v. Commo nwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 72 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 20, 2018). Sufficient evidence supported defendants conviction for breaking and entering, larceny, larceny with intent to sell, and obtaining money by false pretenses be cause, on the same days the burglaries occurred, defendant sold the items stolen from those houses and he had at least two prior larceny convictions. Defendants explanationthat he coincidentally rang the victims doorbell on the same day that his acquaintance broke into their houses, stole several items, and sold those items to defendant, who then sold them that same day while having no knowledge that they were stolenwas unreasonable. Sigler v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 67 (Va. Ct . App. Mar. 15, 2022).

Wright v. Commonwealth, 196 Va. 132, 82 S.E.2d 603, 1954 Va. LEXIS 208 (1954). Although the trial court erred by convicting defendant of violating § 18.2-95, instead of § 18.2-108, after the jury found defendant guilty of grand larceny by receiving stolen property, the trial courts failure to include a reference to § 18.2-108 in its final order was a clerical error that did not require reversal.

Effect of fa ilure to demand statement under § 18.2-111.  The accused having been indicted for larceny and having failed to exercise his right under § 18.2-111 to demand a statement in writing from the attorney for th e Commonwealth of what he intended to rely upon to ask for a conviction, the prosecuting attorney was entitled to ask for a conviction for receiving stolen bonds, or for receiving lost bonds, as might be shown by the evidence. Hutchinson v. Commonwealth, 133 Va. 710, 112 S.E. 624, 1922 Va. LEXIS 130 (1922). To convict an offender under this section, four things must be proved: (1) that the good s or other things were previously stolen by some other person; (2) that the accused bought or received them from another person, or aided in concealing them; (3) that at the time the accused bought or received them, or aided in concealing them, he knew t hat they had been stolen; and (4) that he bought or received them, or aided in concealing them, malo animo or with a dishonest intent.

Commonwealth, 225 Va. 48, 301 S.E.2d 152, 1983 Va. LEXIS 190 (1983).

Commonwealth, No. 0352-89-1 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 21, 1990). In order to support defendants conviction of grand larceny, the evidence must show beyond a reasonable doubt that he: (1) received fifty or more dollars of st olen money from another, or aided in concealing such amount of stolen money, (2) knowing the same to be stolen, and (3) so received or aided in concealing such stolen amount of money with a dishonest intent. Wright v. Commonwealth, 196 Va. 132, 82 S.E.2d 603, 1954 Va. LEXIS 208 (1954). To prove the corpus delicti and to establish the guilt of the defendant, the Commonwealth has the burden of showing: (1) that goods of the value of more than $50 were previously stolen by some other person; (2) the defendant aided in concealing them; (3) that at the time he so aided in concealing them, he knew they had been stolen; and (4) that he so aided in concealing them with a dishonest intent. Parish v. Com monwealth, 206 Va. 627, 145 S.E.2d 192, 1965 Va. LEXIS 244 (1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 942, 86 S. Ct. 1463, 16 L. Ed. 2d 540, 1966 U.S. LEXIS 1681 (1966); Pasanello v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 640, 145 S.E.2d 200, 1965 Va. LEXIS 245 (1965). Evidence insufficient to prove inten t.  Evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove the requisite intent for larceny, where the Commonwealths uncontradicted evidence did not exclude as a r easonable hypothesis that defendant came upon a pair of stolen jet skis in the woods and used them with the intent of returning them each day to that place. Lee v. Commonwealth, No. 0352-89-1 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 21, 1990). Even if the evidence were sufficient to show that appellant knew the vehicle was stolen, mere presence in and subsequent flight from the vehicle was insufficient to show that the accused aided in concealing it with a dishonest intent. Reid v. Commonwealth, No. 0480-93-1 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 4, 1994). To convict a defendant under this section, the Commonwealth must prove that property was: (1) previously stolen by another; and (2) received by defendant; (3) wit h knowledge of the theft; and (4) a dishonest intent. Snow v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 766, 537 S.E.2d 6, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 754 (2000). Conviction is dependen t upon guilty knowledge.  This section makes a conviction dependent upon guilty knowledge, and the Commonwealth must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused received from another p erson any stolen goods or other thing, knowing the same to have been stolen. Kanter v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 524, 199 S.E. 477, 1938 Va. LEXIS 308 (1938). The testimony of two police officers describing the defendants frantic efforts to evade the police in a stolen vehicle, as well as the testimony by one office r concerning the popped ignition and the defendants statement that he believed one of the other occupants had stolen the vehicle, if believed by the fact finder, were sufficient to prove receipt of the stolen vehicle with the requisite knowle dge required by this section. Snow v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 766, 537 S.E.2d 6, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 754 (2000). The defendants dishonest intent in aiding in the concealment of the goods not only may, but usually must, be shown by circumstantial evidence. Parish v.

This section is not by itself vague. Statutes are not read in isolation where there exis ts a judicial gloss on their meaning. Mechling v. Slayton, 361 F. Supp. 770, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12896 (E.D. Va. 1973). Embezzlement is a statutory crime. Moss v. Harwood, 102 Va. 386, 46 S.E. 385, 1904 Va. LE XIS 82 (1904). Elements of offense.  A person entrusted with possession of anothers personalty who converts such property to his own use or benefit is guilty of the statutory offense of embezzlem ent. Evans v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 292, 308 S.E.2d 126, 1983 Va. LEXIS 318 (1983). To establish the crime of embezzlement under this section, the Commonwealth must prove that the accused wrongfully appropriated to his or her own use or benefit, with the intent to deprive the owner thereof, the property entrusted or delivered to the accused. However, proof of the misappropriation of property entrusted to the possession of the accused is insufficient, standing alone, to prove that the accused was the embezzler. Zoretic v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 241, 409 S.E.2d 832, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1126, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 273 (1991). Em bezzlement, larceny distinguished.  Embezzlement and larceny are separate offenses with different elements. The key distinction between embezzlement and larceny is that larceny involves a trespassor y taking of property while embezzlement involves a conversion of property received with the owners consent. Cera v. Commonwealth, No. 0432-94-4 (Ct. of Appeals May 2, 1995). Larceny and embezzlement are not the same offense for determining time limits under § 19.2-243. Cera v. Commonwealth, No. 0432-94-4 (Ct. of Appeals May 2, 199 5). Under Virginia law, embezzlement, false pretenses, and larceny are three separate offenses and there is not a general theft statute, as there is in most s tates, that encompasses both types of behavior, and § 18.2-95 defines grand larceny; § 18.2-111 defines embezzlement; and § 18.2-178 defines false pretenses. The Commonwealth of Virginia has always purported to treat the three basic theft crimes of larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses as separate and distinct offenses, and maintains separate statutes for each crime. United States v. Good, 326 F.3d 589, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 7543 (4th Cir. 2003). Proof of embezzlement not sufficient to support larceny charge.  Proof of embezzlement does not support a conviction under an indictment alleging larceny. While prior to being amended in 1994, this section permitted a defendant to be indicted as for larceny, and proof of embezzlement was sufficient to sustain a larceny charge, these provisions were eliminated by the 1994 amendments. By eliminating these provisions, the General Assembly intended to change the law so tha t proof of embezzlement is no longer sufficient to sustain a larceny charge. Bruhn v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 339, 544 S.E.2d 895, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 216 (2001). General Assembly intended the current version of the statute to preclude conviction under an indictment for larceny on proof of embezzlement. Bruhn v. Commonwealt h, 37 Va. App. 537, 559 S.E.2d 880, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 127, aff'd, 264 Va. 597, 570 S.E.2d 866, 2002 Va. LEXIS 166 (2002). The legislature only recently eliminated the election provision in this section, supporting the conclusion that the legislatures deletion of the election prov ision was generated by and followed from its amendment making the crime charged and the crime underlying the conviction one and the same. Bruhn v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 537, 559 S.E.2d 880, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 127, aff'd, 264 Va. 597, 570 S.E.2d 866, 2002 Va. LEXIS 166 (2002). First sentence of § 18.2-111 provides that any person committing the described acts shall be guilty of embezzlement, and the only reference to larceny is in th e second sentence, which now states that embezzlement shall be deemed larceny and upon conviction thereof, the person shall be punished as provided in the larceny code sections. Commonwealth v. Bruhn, 264 Va. 597, 570 S.E.2d 866, 2002 Va. LEXIS 166 (2002 ). The 1994 amendments to § 18.2-111, regarding embezzlement deemed larceny, were not narrowly tailored to eliminate unneeded language, but constituted a complete reformulation of the statute, and most particularly, the elimination of the permissive provision that embezzlement could be indicted as for larceny evinces a clear legislative intent to require specificity in the indictment. Commonwealth v. Bruh n, 264 Va. 597, 570 S.E.2d 866, 2002 Va. LEXIS 166 (2002). When defendant kept money given to him on behalf of his employer, the evidence was insufficient to convict him of larceny, due to the absence of a trespassory tak ing, and he could not be considered guilty under § 18.2-111, which, prior to its amendment, had allowed someone found guilty of the elements of embezzlement to be considered guilty of larceny, but now required that defendant be specifically charged wi th embezzlement. Commonwealth v. Bruhn, 264 Va. 597, 570 S.E.2d 866, 2002 Va. LEXIS 166 (2002). Mental element of the crime of embezzlement is a fraudulent purpose to deprive the owner of his property and to appropriate the same. Bain v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 89, 205 S.E.2d 641, 1974 Va. LEXIS 236 (1974). To constitute the statutory crime of embezzlement it is necessary to prove that an accused wrongfully appropriated to his own use or benefit, with the intent to d eprive the owner thereof, the property of another which has been entrusted to him by reason of his employment or office. Revell v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 708, 213 S.E.2d 756, 1975 Va. LEXIS 215 (1975). Delivered as an alternative element to entrusted.  Focus in case law on the entrustment aspect of the crime of embezzlement, § 18.2-111, did not exclude the alternative element of delivered as an option to constitute a completed embezzlement; delivered following the disjunctive or demonstrated that the General Assembly intended this to be a separate and alternative element from entrusted. Pittman v. Commonwealth, 69 Va. App. 632, 822 S. E.2d 382, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 1 (2019). Section 18.2-112 emphasizes the conversion of property by someone in a position of trust who, by virtue of their position, exercises control over the property converted or has custody of the property. Ratliff v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 43, 455 S.E.2d 259, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 270 (1995). Formal fiduciary relationship not necessary.  In order to prove embezzlement, however, the existence of a formal fiduciary relationship is not necessary. Rather, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant was entrusted with the property of another. In this case, victim entrusted defendant as his insurance agent, with $1,400 to pay over to insurance company. The court found irrespective of § 38.2-1813 that these facts established the required entrustme nt to sustain defendants conviction. Chiang v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 13, 365 S.E.2d 778, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1892, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (1988). Evidence showed an embezzlement of entrusted funds because, (1) before defendant and an investor signed a shareholders agreement, the investor did not give de fendant discretion to use the funds as defendant pleased, and, (2) after the shareholders agreement was signed, proof of defendants formal fiduciary relationship with the investor was unnecessary, as funds were embezzled from the companies. Norda n v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 194 (Va. Ct. App. July 17, 2018). Defendant, a real estate subdivision developer, was entitled to strike an embezzlement indictment because the evidence was insufficient to prove the money, which was paid by property owners for road maintenance fees, was the property of another entrusted to defendant. Ware v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 212 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 1, 2019). Requisite intent.  To establish the requisite intent, it is not necessary to show that the defendant wrongfully appropriated the entrusted property to his or her own personal use or ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-112"><akn:num>§ 18.2-112</akn:num><akn:heading>Embezzlement by officers, etc</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>, of public or other funds; default in paying over funds evidence of guilt. Text If any officer, agent or employee of the Commonwealth or of any city, town, county, or any other political subdivision, or the deputy of any such officer having custody of public funds, or other funds coming into his custody under his official capacity, knowingly misuse or misappropriate the same or knowingly dispose thereof otherwise than in accordance with law, he shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony; and any default of such officer, agent, employee or deputy in paying over any such funds to the proper authorities when required by law to do so shall be deemed prima facie evidence of his guilt.

CASE NOTES This section deals with public officials in possession of public funds and requires that they do not knowingly misuse or misappropriate such funds, or knowingly use them in a way not in accordance with the law, regardless of whether they were prompted by a criminal intent. Crider v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 574, 145 S.E.2d 222, 1965 Va. LEXIS 237 (1965). Section does not create an express trust for 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(4) purposes. A trus t imposed ex maleficio is insufficient to give rise to the existence of a fiduciary relationship for the purposes of bankruptcy law. On the basis of these considerations, no fiduciary relationship exists between the Commonwealth and the debtors which wou ld warrant nondischargeability in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(4) as a defalcation in fiduciary duty. Virginia Comm'n of Game &amp; Inland Fisheries v. Myers, 52 Bankr. 901, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 5439 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). Section is directed against fraudulent and felonious misuse.  This section is directed against the fraudulent and felonious misuse and misappropriation of public funds by an officer of the state, and not against the mere fai lure to pay over such funds within the required time. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 104 Va. 888, 52 S.E. 690, 1906 Va. LEXIS 97 (1906). This section emphasizes the conversion of property by someone in a position of trust who , by virtue of their position, exercises control over the property converted or has custody of the property. Ratliff v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 43, 455 S.E.2d 259, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 270 (1995). An essential element of this section is the custody of the funds that are misappropriate d. Ratliff v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 43, 455 S.E.2d 259, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 270 (1995). Custody.  If a person charged with an offense under this section does not physically possess the property, the element of custody requires proof that the person had the authority to dispose of or distribute the funds. Ratliff v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 43, 455 S.E.2d 259, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 270 (1995). Knowingly misusing funds is em bezzlement.  If a person knowingly misuses or misappropriates money which has once come into his hands as treasurer, or knowingly disposes thereof otherwise than in ac cordance with law, he is guilty of the embezzlement thereof under this section. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Board of Supvrs., 160 Va. 11, 168 S.E. 617, 1933 Va. LEXIS 188 (1933). The essence of the crime is the scienter, the guilty knowledge of the defendant that the payments obtained by her for overtime were a misuse or misappropriation o f public funds, or a disposition of them not in accordance with law. Crider v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 574, 145 S.E.2d 222, 1965 Va. LEXIS 237 (1965). The proof required is that the defendant used or disposed of the public funds in her charge knowing that such use or disposition was a misuse or misappropriation of the funds or not in accordance with the law. Crider v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 574, 145 S.E.2d 222, 1965 Va. LEXIS 237 (1965). Fraudulent intent is not necessary.  While the detention of public funds may be done with fraudulent intent, fraudulent intent is not a necessary element of the offense created by this section. If th e forbidden act or acts are done knowingly, a violation occurs. Crider v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 574, 145 S.E.2d 222, 1965 Va. LEXIS 237 (1965). Money may be detained without being misappropriated. Crider v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 574, 145 S.E.2d 222, 1965 Va. LEXIS 237 (1965). The detention of the money is one of the elements constituting the offense, but it does not constitute the offense itself. Crider v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 574, 14 5 S.E.2d 222, 1965 Va. LEXIS 237 (1965). A peace bond is in the nature of a conditional fine. As such, and until the condition is satisfied and the payor becomes entitled to reimbursement, the cash is moneys belonging to the state and its embezzlement by a public officer is a violation of this section. Healy v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 325, 191 S.E.2d 736, 1972 Va. LEXIS 355 (1972). Words not imputing to officer larceny or embezzlement.  To publish of a chief of police that he has within the last past twelve months collected certain fines of Officer P., which fines do not appear by the records of the police court to have been reported, does not impute to him the crime of larceny or embezzlement. Moss v. Harwood, 102 Va. 386, 46 S.E. 385, 1904 Va. LEXIS 82 (1904). Not ne cessary to prove embezzlement of whole sum charged.  On a charge of embezzlement of a given sum it is not necessary to prove the embezzlement of the whole sum charged in the indictment. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 104 Va. 888, 52 S.E. 690, 1906 Va. LEXIS 97 (1906). Indictment held sufficient.  An indictment which charges that a justice of the peace, by virtue of his office, had the custody of five dollars of the public funds of the state, which he was r equired to pay to the clerk of the circuit court of his county, and that he feloniously and knowingly did misuse and misappropriate, and feloniously and knowingly disposed of the same otherwise than by paying the same over to said clerk, in accordance wi th law, and concluding with a charge of larceny and embezzlement, is a sufficient indictment for a felony under this section. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 104 Va. 888, 52 S.E. 690, 1906 Va. LEXIS 97 (1906). Evidence sufficient to suppo rt conviction.  Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction for knowingly misappropriating funds that came into her custody and possession by virtue of her posit ion as an employee of the citys school system, as it established that she received a check based on the community colleges purchase of an ad for her schools football program and that she knowingly misappropriated the funds because the check w as made payable to the citys high school, yet she endorsed the check with her name, and deposited the funds into her personal account at a credit union rather than give the check to the school bookkeeper as her duties required her to do. Gunn v. Comm onwealth, 272 Va. 580, 637 S.E.2d 324, 2006 Va. LEXIS 116 (2006). Evidence held sufficient to support conviction of deputy treasurer for embezzlement of f unds from county treasurers office. Orr v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 371, 344 S.E.2d 627, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 282 (1986). Jury instruction.  Defendants conviction was reversed for error in instructing the jury that they should find her guilty if she caused the overtime payments to be made knowi ng that such expenditures of public funds were not authorized by the town council or manager. Crider v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 574, 145 S.E.2d 222, 1965 Va. LEXIS 237 (1965). § 18.2-112.1. Misuse of public assets; penalty. Text A. For purpose s of this section, public assets means personal property belonging to or paid for by the Commonwealth, or any city, town, county, or any other political subdivision, or the labor of any person other than the accused that is paid for by the Common wealth, or any city, town, county, or any other political subdivision. B. Any full-ti me officer, agent, or employee of the Commonwealth, or of any city, town, county, or any other political subdivision who, without lawful authorization, uses or permits the use of public assets for private or personal purposes unrelated to the duties and office of the accused or any other legitimate government interest when the value of such use exceeds $1,000 in any 12-month period, is guilty of a Class 4 felony. C. Any county, city, or town shall be permitted to adopt a local ordinance that provides that any non-full-time officer, agent, employee, or elected official of the county, city, or town who, without lawful authorization, uses or permits the use of public assets for p rivate or personal purposes unrelated to the duties and office of the accused or any other legitimate government interest when the value of such use exceeds $1,000 in any 12-month period is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.

In any prosecution hereunder, the fact that such person after demand therefor by the lienholder or person in whom the title or ownership of the property is, or his agen t, shall fail or refuse to disclose to such claimant or his agent the location of the property, or to surrender the same, shall be prima facie evidence of the violation of the provisions of this section.

CASE NOTES Fraud contemplated by this section is an act by a debtor intended to deprive a secured c reditor of his collateral by appropriating it to the debtors own use. Bain v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 89, 205 S.E.2d 641, 1974 Va. LEXIS 236 (1974). The fraud contemplated is an act by a debtor intended to deprive a secured creditor of his collateral by appropriating it to the debtors own use and is to be distinguished from the definition of fraud in civil cases which requires a misrepresentation of fact intended to induce another to part with something of value.

Fraud directed against l ienor or title holder.  This section requires proof that fraudulent intent be directed against the lienor or person in whom the title is rather than against an innocent purchaser or subs equent creditor. Bain v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 89, 205 S.E.2d 641, 1974 Va. LEXIS 236 (1974). Section violated whether fraudulent intent formed within or outside state.  Where the secured property is disposed of without the consent of the lienor by the debtor appropriating it to his own use, a fraudulent disposal has occurred with in the meaning of the statute, regardless of whether the fraudulent intent is formed within or outside the boundaries of Virginia.

Failure to return collateral upon demand by lienholder is prima facie evidence of violation of this section. Where such a failure occurs, even the existence of written permission to remove the collateral is immaterial under this section, as the creditor need not show the lack of such permission to make out a prima facie case. Lewi s v. First Nat'l Bank, 645 F. Supp. 1499, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18908 (W.D. Va. 1986), aff'd, 818 F.2d 861, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 6037 (4th Cir. 1987). Debtors sale of collateral.  Even though a banks security interest was unrecorded and therefore unperfected as to third parties, the bank was entitled to rely upon and enforce its securit y agreement against defaulting debtor, and as debtors subsequent sale deprived the bank of its right to sell the collateral upon default, the banks security interest comes within the purview of this section. Bain v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 89, 205 S.E.2d 641, 1974 Va. LEXIS 236 (1974). Where the evidence proved that defendant sold the equipment in question in contravention of the lease and that he was aware that the lease terms required written consent before the equipment could be sold, this was sufficient to convict under this statute. Compton v. Commonwealth, 22 Va. App. 751, 473 S.E.2d 95, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 542 (199 6). Evidence that defendant removed property from Virginia in violation of a security agreement and that he transferred the property to a dealer in Pennsylvania in ex change for a credit on property he purchased from that dealer was sufficient to prove fraudulent conversion in violation of this section. Landes v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 710, 561 S.E.2d 37, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 180 (2002). Failure to leave forwarding address or to contact creditor waived right to deny that demand made.  Even assuming that the debtor did not actually receive the demand for return of the collateral, her failure to leave a functional forwarding address or contact th e creditor constituted a waiver of her right to deny that the demand was made. Lewis v. First Nat'l Bank, 645 F. Supp. 1499, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18908 (W.D. Va. 1986), aff'd, 818 F.2d 861, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 6037 (4th Cir. 1987). Proceedings under this section not extreme or outrageous where probable cause exists.  The initiation of criminal proceedings against someone under this section with probable cause is not extreme or outrageous as a matter of law. If it were, any pro secution under this section that was terminated would be grounds for a suit, and the statute would be essentially useless, as lienholders would fear being liable for infliction of emotional distress.

Jurisdiction proper in county where lien created and failure to obtain consent to disposal occurred.  Jurisdiction was proper in Botetourt County, where the lien was created and the failure to obtain the banks consent to the disposal of its collateral both occ urred in Botetourt County and only the formation of the intent to deprive the bank of its collateral and the actual disposal of the tractor occurred outside of this state. The harm which this section is intended to prevent is the economic injury caused t o the secured party by defendants actions and the infringement of the lien created in Virginia. Gregory v.

Unlawful sublease of a motor vehicle; penalty. Text A. It shall be unlawful for any person, for profit in the course of business, who is not a party to a lease contract, conditional sales contract, or security agreement which transfers any right or interest in a motor vehicle, knowing that the motor vehicle is subject to a lease, security interest or lien, to: 1. Obtai n or exercise control over a motor vehicle and sell, transfer, assign, or lease the motor vehicle to another person without the prior written authorization of the secured creditor, lessor, or lienholder if he receives compensation or other consideration for the sale, transfer, assignment, or lease of the motor vehicle; or 2.

CASE NOTES Legislative intent.  The label affixed by the legislature to the crime defined in this section, larceny after bailment, clearly indicates an intent to create a new statutory crime, in corporating some elements of the existing crime of larceny, defined as it was at common law. United States v. Parker, 522 F.2d 801, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 12783 (4th Cir. 1975). Virginia has not enacted a statutory definition of larceny, looking instead to the common law. United States v. Parker, 522 F.2d 801, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 12783 ( 4th Cir. 1975). This section does not codify the common-law crime of larceny but rather creates a statut ory offense for failing to return the property in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Ketchum v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 258, 403 S.E.2d 382, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2100, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 66 (1991). The failure of this section to require mens rea or scienter is not fatal to its constitutionality.  A claim that a statute on its face contains no requirement of mens rea or scienter is no ground for holding the statute unconstitutional, since such requirement w ill be read into the statute by the court when it appears the legislature implicitly intended that it must be proved. Maye v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 48, 189 S.E.2d 350, 1972 Va. LEXIS 301 (1972). Mens rea or scienter must be proven.  This section implicitly requires proof of an element of mens rea or scienter, even though the requirement does not appear in the statute. Molash v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 243, 348 S.E.2d 868, 3 Va. Law Rep. 832, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 358 (1986). Proof of intent to permanently deprive owner of his or her property is not required to s ustain a conviction under this section. Ketchum v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 258, 403 S.E.2d 382, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2100, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 66 (1991). Vagueness of section.  This section is not so vague as to deny to the average individual of ordinary intelligence fair notice that certain actions are proscribed. United States v. Parke r, 522 F.2d 801, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 12783 (4th Cir. 1975). Elements of crime.  The first sentence of this section clearly sets forth two elements of the conduct prohibited thereunder: (1) the actor must be a bailee of an animal, aircraft, ve hicle, boat or vessel; and (2) he must fail to return such possession in accordance with the terms of the bailment agreement. United States v. Parker, 522 F.2d 801, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 12783 (4th Cir. 1975). Elements of common-law larceny which are consistent with a taking by a bailee, such as the intent at the time of taking to permanently deprive another of his poss ession, would be incorporated in the crime, while elements not consistent therewith, such as a trespassory taking, would not be. United States v. Parker, 522 F.2d 801, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 12783 (4th Cir. 1975). The distinction between larceny after bailment and the common-law offense of larceny is that in the former it is not necessary to allege or prove that the original taking was trespassory. Maye v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 48, 189 S.E.2d 350, 1972 Va. LEXIS 301 (1972). The statutory crime of larceny after bailment does not require a trespassory taking of the personal property of another. United States v. Closkey, 411 F.2d 1212, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 11856 (4th Cir. 1969). Where there was no written agreement between bailors and bailees and the bailors of the property had taken possession of it within two days of its abandonment by the bailees, that portion of the statute establishing a prima facie case was not applicable. Molash v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 243, 348 S.E.2d 868, 3 Va. Law Rep. 832, 1986 Va. Ap p. LEXIS 358 (1986). Intent.  Nowhere in this section is there an explicit requirement of criminal intent. United States v. Parker, 522 F.2d 801, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 12783 (4th Cir. 1975). Despite defendants claims to the contrary, the circumstantial evidence, particularly defendants conduct, established that he intended to permanently depri ve victim of car. Yancey v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 428 (Va. Ct. App. July 30, 2002). Defendant convicted under improper statute.  Defendants failure to return a lease vehicle was within the purview of § 18.2-117, not § 18.2-118, the statute under which he was convicted, and thus, d efendant was convicted under the wrong statute. Since, based on the facts of the case, it was legally impossible for defendant to violate § 18.2-118, a manifest injustice occurred. Masika v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. App. 330, 757 S.E.2d 571, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 160 (2014). Application of prima facie presumption held proper.  Trial court properly applied the prima facie presumption under § 18.2-117 that defendant had a fraudulent intent to commit larceny for failure to return a rent al car to the rental car company because the evidence showed that the car was not recovered until more than five days after the date it should have been returned. Further, the defendants evidence did not rebut the presumption because it failed to exp lain why he did not return the car between the date that it was due and the date that he was hospitalized, which was four days after the due date, and defendant provided no dates or documentation to verify that he had been hospitalized at another hospita l due to a suicide attempt during the four-day period. Newport v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 152 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 19, 2005). Fraudulent intent held not establi shed.  Where defendants, who were long-distance truck drivers employed to haul freight, argued that they merely left the trailer at a truck stop, told its rightful posse ssor of its location, and went home to Minnesota, there was no evidence that excluded the hypothesis that defendants became disillusioned with their employment and merely left the trailer where it was when they decided to quit, and the testimony that the y notified the lawful possessor of the trailer of its location when they quit, was not contradicted by any other witness, fraudulent intent on the part of the defendants was not established. Molash v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 243, 348 S.E.2d 868, 3 Va. L aw Rep. 832, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 358 (1986). Probable cause found.  There was probable cause for plaintiffs arrest, imprisonment, and subsequent prosecution for failure to return a rental vehicle, because plaintiffs failur e to return his rental car within five days after the date set forth in his rental agreement was prima facie evidence of a violation under the terms of the statute. Curtis v. Devlin, No. 1:04cv409, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6703 (E.D. Va. Apr. 19, 2005). Sufficiency of evidence.  Evidence was sufficient to find defendant guilty of violating § 18.2-117 where the car owner testified that defendant kept her car for more than a day longer t han agreed upon. Since the owners testimony was not inherently incredible, the trial courts finding that the car owner was more credible than defendant controlled. James v. State, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 449 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2007). Sufficient evidence supported defendants conviction of failing to return bailed property because (1) proof of intent to permanently deprive the owner was not required, and (2) defendants required fraudulent intent was proved, as the statute said a failure to return the property within five days of a due date showed such intent prima facie, a trial court did not have to believe defendants testimony tha t defendant thought a car defendant rented had been paid for, and a rational jury could infer such intent from defendants failure to communicate with the rental car company after the due date and conclude defendant did not rebut the statutory inferen ce of fraudulent intent.

Whenever an y person is in possession or control of any personal property, by virtue of or subject to a written lease of such property, except property described in § 18.2-117 or in the Virginia Lease-Purchase Agreement Act (§ 59.1-207.17 et seq.), and such pe rson so in possession or control shall, with intent to defraud, sell, secrete, or destroy the property, or dispose of the property for his own use, or fraudulently remove the same from the Commonwealth without the written consent of the lessor thereof, o r fail to return such property to the lessor thereof within 30 days after expiration of the lease or rental period for such property stated in such written lease, he shall be deemed guilty of the larceny thereof. B. The fact th at such person signs the lease or rental agreement with a name other than his own, or fails to return such property to the lessor thereof within 30 days after the giving of written notice to such person that the lease or rental period for such property h as expired, shall be prima facie evidence of intent to defraud. For purposes of this section, notice mailed by certified mail and addressed to such person at the address of the lessee stated in the lease, shall be sufficient giving of written notice unde r this section. C. The venue o f prosecution under this section shall be the county or city in which such property was leased or in which such accused person last had a legal residence. D. The court s hall order a person found guilty of an offense under this section to make restitution as the court deems appropriate to the lessor. Such restitution may include (i) the cost of repairing such property; (ii) if the property is not returned or cannot reaso nably be repaired, the actual value of such property; and (iii) any reasonable loss of revenue by the lessor resulting from the fraudulent conversion or removal of such property.

CASE NOTES Construction.  Because there was no ambiguity to resolve within the statute, lenity had no place in the courts analysis. Sharp v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 348 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 24, 2015). Because defendant presented no evidence that the legislative amendment was intended to interpret or clarify the original act, the presumption that legislative ame ndments were presumed as intended to effect a change in the law remained unrebutted; the 2014 amendment effected a change, not a clarification, to the scope of the statute. Sharp v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 348 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 24, 2015). Value not proven.  Defendants conviction for grand larceny was improper because the Commonwealth failed to prove that the value of the jackhammer that defendant rented was at le ast $200. The only evidence of the jackhammers value that the trial court found persuasive, which was its original purchase price and replacement cost, was insufficient to prove its worth. Byrum v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 211 (Va. Ct. App. May 18, 2010). Fraudulent intent.  Ends of justice exception in Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 did not apply to allow the appellate court to review defendants contention that fraudulent intent u nder § 18.2-118 had not been proven because the Commonwealth was not entitled to the prima facie showing of fraudulent intent. Defendant failed to raise this issue with the trial court, and the record did not contain evidence affirmatively pro ving that defendant had no intent to defraud; instead, the evidence clearly indicated that defendant leased a television set, that he did not pay for it, and that he failed to return it or contact the store to explain his failure. McDowell v. Commonwealt h, 57 Va. App. 308, 701 S.E.2d 820, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 453 (2010), vacated, 282 Va. 341, 718 S.E.2d 772, 2011 Va. LEXIS 231 (2011). Trial court erred in convicting defendant of fraudulent conversion of leased personal property because, although defendant breached defendants written lease a greement with a rental company, the evidence failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to defraud the company by failing to abide by the terms of the agreement. The evidence showed only that defendant failed to make rental payment s or to return a leased television set to the rental company after defendant failed to make the lease payments required by the lease agreement. Bert v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 18, 2011). Defendant was properly convicted of failing to return leased property because she possessed the requisite fraudulent intent to withhold the property; defendant wa s clearly aware of her obligations under the lease-purchase agreement, and despite her promises to the contrary, she made no effort to pay for the furniture or to return it to the store. Sharp v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 348 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 2 4, 2015). Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of fraudulently failing to return rental property because, based on the terms of the rental agreement, the demand let ter, and the circumstantial evidence showing defendants evasive and uncommunicative conduct, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that he had fraudulent intent in failing to return the victims property within 30 days after expiration of the ren tal period. The express terms of the rental agreement required return of the equipment on September 18, 2018, defendant had rented the equipment with an incorrect name, address, and phone number, and the equipment was returned nearly a year later. Sarka v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. App. 56, 854 S.E.2d 204, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (2021). Notice sufficient.  Notice requirement of subsection B of § 18.2-118 was satisfied by a store sending defendant a notice to his apartment that his failure to return rented propert y might result in prosecution. Adding the apartment number and the city to the address stated in the lease agreement did not violate the notice requirements as the address was even more accurate than the one in the agreement. McDowell v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. App. 308, 701 S.E.2d 820, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 453 (2010), vacated, 282 Va. 341, 718 S.E.2d 772, 2011 Va. LEXIS 231 (2011). Failure to return rental property conviction under § 18.2-118 was supported by sufficient evidence. While the date testified to by the store manager as the dat e that defendant rented the equipment was only a day before the sheriff recovered the property, the managers testimony that defendant had the property for a couple of months and that substantial rent charges accrued as a result of defendants fail ure to return the equipment supported the trial courts resolution of the conflict in the evidence. Commonwealth v. McNeal, 282 Va. 16, 710 S.E.2d 733, 2011 Va. LEXIS 129 (2011). Defendant convicted under improper statute.  Defendants failure to return a lease vehicle was within the purview of § 18.2-117, not § 18.2-118, the statute under which he was convicted, and thus, d efendant was convicted under the wrong statute. Since, based on the facts of the case, it was legally impossible for defendant to violate § 18.2-118, a manifest injustice occurred. Masika v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. App. 330, 757 S.E.2d 571, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 160 (2014). Evidence sufficient.  Defendants conviction for fraudulently converting rental property, in violation of § 18.2-118, was supported by evidence that defendant entered into a rent al agreement for a television, only made the initial payment, and falsely said the television was broken and that she had thrown it away, when the television had been pawned for $300. Haley v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 182 (Va. Ct. App. June 11, 2013). Lease-purchase agreement defendant signed constituted a lease under the statute, and thus, withholding personal property in violation of the terms of that agreeme nt violated the statute. Sharp v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 348 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 24, 2015). Trial court did not err in denying appellants motion to strike the evidence as insufficient to establish fraudulent intent under § 18.2-118 where the evide nce showed that a certified letter was sent to the address he listed on a lease agreement, appellant failed to make any payments beyond what was necessary to gain possession of the television, and appellant listed a wrong phone number and address on the rental form and failed to return the rented television within 30 days of the letter. Outsey v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 360 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 8, 2015). Tr espass conviction did not preclude burglary conviction.  Defendants trespass conviction did not preclude the conviction for statutory burglary because the record supported the trial courts finding that he entere d the apartment with the intent to commit another misdemeanor, destruction of property, in addition to trespass; the day after an angry outburst, defendant forced entry into the victims apartment and damaged personal property inside.

The increased punishments provided by the 1958 and 1960 amendments to this section, and the addition of § 18.2-120, may fairly be said to have been enacted wit h an eye to the sit-in. The legislatures motive alone, however, could not invalidate the statute. Besides, the criminal elements of the present statutes are no more expansive than were those of the 1934 trespass statute. Henderson v. Trailway Bus Co., 194 F. Supp. 423, 1961 U.S. Dist.

Commonwealth v. Hicks, 267 Va. 573, 596 S.E.2d 74, 2004 Va. LEXIS 75 (2004). First Amendment right of association and right to due process not violated.  The issuance of trespass notices barring two defendants from coming onto the premises of a public housing complex and the subsequent prosecution of those defendan ts for trespassing on the premises did not violate the defendants First Amendment right of association or their right to due process. Collins v. Commonwealth, 30 Va. App. 443, 517 S.E.2d 277, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 492 (1999). Violation of Interstate Commerce Act.  Where a bus terminal and restaurant were operated as an integral part of an interstate bus companys transportation service for interstate passengers, a convic tion under this section of a black patron who refused to leave the portion of the restaurant reserved for white patrons was reversed as a violation of the Interstate Commerce Act. Boynton v. Virginia, 364 U.S. 454, 81 S. Ct. 182, 5 L. Ed. 2d 206, 1960 U. S. LEXIS 1889 (1960). Housing Authoritys trespass procedure not overbroad.  In reversing the Virginia Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court held that the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authoritys trespassing policy, which barred people with no legitimate business or social purpose from entering, was not overbroad. Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, 123 S. Ct. 2191, 156 L. Ed. 2d 148, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 4782 (2003) (reversing Commonwealth v. Hicks, 264 Va. 48, 563 S.E .2d 674 (2002)). Trial courts entry of trespass conviction against defendant was upheld, as defendants argument that the trespass policy was vague, had to be rejected; def endant received a hand-delivered letter, which he signed and acknowledged, that directed him not to return to the housing authoritys property and he had been convicted pursuant to that statute on two prior occasions for criminal trespass on the housi ng authoritys property, which meant the statute and trespass policy were not vague. Commonwealth v. Hicks, 267 Va. 573, 596 S.E.2d 74, 2004 Va. LEXIS 75 (2004). Section protects property rights.  The only purpose of this section is to protect the rights of the owners or those in lawful control of private property. Hall v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 72, 49 S.E.2 d 369, 1948 Va. LEXIS 146 (1948); Price v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 383, 164 S.E.2d 676, 1968 Va. LEXIS 244 (1968). In Hall v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 72, 49 S.E.2d 369 (1948), the statement that the only purpose of this section is to protect the rights of the owners or those in lawful control of private property was made in the context of a controversy whether the trespass statute could be applied, consistently with First and Fourth Amendment guarantees, to the use of passageways in a privately owned apartment building and the case did not involve the applicability of the trespass statute to property owned by the Commonwealth. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 579, 186 S.E.2d 53, 1972 Va. LEXIS 212, cert. denied, 407 U.S. 925, 92 S. Ct. 2458, 32 L. Ed. 2d 812, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 2 191 (1972). Trespass not lesser-included offense of statutory burglary.  Trespass in violation of this section is not a lesser-included offense of § 18.2-91 and a trial court lacks the authority to convict for trespass under an indi ctment charging breaking and entering even if the accused fails to object. Shifflett v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 843 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2000). When defendant was indicted for burglary, in violation of § 18.2-89, he could not validly be convicted of trespass, in violation of § 18.2-119, as statutory trespass was not a lesser-included offense of common-law burglary, unless he acquiesced in such a conviction, and counsels statements leading the trial court to believe it could convict defendant of trespass if it found the evidence insufficient to convict him of burglary, were such an acquiescence. Freeman v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 331 (Va. Ct. App. June 10, 2003). Conviction under City of Alexandria Code § 13-1-33(a) compared.  Despite defendants claim that the trial court erred in admitting an improperly authenticated document purportedly authorizing the police to bar persons from t he City of Alexandria Redevelopment Housing Authority property, given the overwhelming evidence of defendants guilt, including his admission that he was barred from said property, but traversed it anyway in an attempt to flee police, his trespassing conviction under City of Alexandria, Va., Code § 13-1-33(a), which substantially tracked the language of § 18.2-119, was upheld on appeal. Thus, any error committed by the trial court in admitting the authorization document into evidence did not su bstantially influence the courts verdict, and was therefore, harmless. Cheeks v. City of Alexandria, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 261 (Va. Ct. App. June 26, 2007). Willful trespass required.  As a penal statute, the Virginia criminal trespass statute has been uniformly construed to require a willful trespass. Reed v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 65, 366 S. E.2d 274, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2156, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 17 (1988). On land under bona fide claim of right.  One cannot be convicted of trespass when one enters or stays upon the land under a bona fide claim of right. Reed v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 65, 366 S.E.2d 274, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2156, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 17 (1988). A good faith belief that one has a right to be on the premises negates criminal intent. Reed v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 65, 366 S.E.2d 274, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2156, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 17 (1988).

CASE NOTES This section applies only to places where a person goes without authority of law, meaning property not at the time affected with a public interest. Racial segregation on property in private demesne has never in law been condemnable. Indeed, the occupant may lawfully forbid any and all persons regardless of his reason or their race o r religion, to enter or remain upon any part of his premises which are not devoted to a public use. Assurance of this right is the entire and sole aim of this section. Henderson v. Trailway Bus Co., 194 F. Supp. 423, 1961 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3263 (E.D. Va. 1961), aff'd, 374 U.S. 488, 83 S. Ct. 1875, 10 L. Ed. 2d 1044, 1963 U.S. LEXIS 982 (1963). It was enacted with an eye to the sit-in.  The increased punishments provided by the 1958 and 1960 amendments to § 18.2-119, and the addition of this section, may fairly be said to have been enacted wit h an eye to the sit-in. The legislatures motive alone however, could not invalidate the statute. Besides, the criminal elements of the present statutes are no more expansive than were those of the 1934 trespass statute. Henderson v. Trailway Bus Co., 194 F. Supp. 423, 1961 U.S. Dist.

As used in this section, disability means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of a persons major life activities. B. It is unlaw ful for any person to enter the land, dwelling, outhouse, or any other building of another for the purpose of damaging such property or any of the contents thereof or in any manner to interfere with the rights of the owner, user, or occupant thereof to u se such property free from interference.Any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. However, if a person intentionally selects the property entered because of the race, religious conviction, color, gender, disa bility, gender identity, sexual orientation, or national origin of the owner, user, or occupant of the property, the person is guilty of a Class 6 felony, and the penalty upon conviction shall include a term of confinement of at least six months.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 5B M.J. Criminal Procedure, § 78; 18 M.J. Trespass, § § 1, 27. CASE NOTES Implied invitation doctrine la cked merit.  Defendants claim that he had an implied invitation to enter property lacked merit with respect to his conviction for entering property for purposes of damaging it or interfering with the owners use thereof because that doctrine was afforded no protection with respect to the instant offense. Lux v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 398 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 17, 2013). This section is not a lesser included offense of statutory burglary. Crump v. Commonwealt h, 13 Va. App. 286, 411 S.E.2d 238, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1460, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (1991). This section is not a lesser included offense of grand larceny.  Trial court erred by reducing the felony grand larceny charge to misdemeanor interference with the property rights of another, because the latter was not a lesser -included offense of grand larceny since a violation of the misdemeanor statute focused on interference while a violation of the grand larceny statute focused on good and chattels over $200. Jones v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 244 (Va. Ct. App. Oc t. 3, 2017). This section is not lesser included offense of § 18.2-90 or § 18.2-91.  Section 18.2-90, which identifies § 18.2-91s prohibited acts, includes offenses against properties not specified in this section, i.e., ships, vessels, riv er craft. Thus, a violation of § 18.2-91 will not invariably and necessarily include a violation of this section and the misdemeanor is, consequently, not a lesser included offense of either § 18.2-90 or § 18.2-91. Crump v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 286, 411 S.E.2d 238, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1460, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (1991). Evidence sufficient.  Defendants conviction for entering property for purposes of damaging it or interfering with the owners use thereof was supported by sufficient evidence be cause he persisted in contacting jurors from his sons trial despite having been ordered by the court and warned by a police officer to cease such activities. Lux v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 398 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 17, 2013). Conviction for unlawful entry upon the property of another was supported by evidence defendant entered unlit home where his child lived with her mother at 3:20 a. m. by forcing the air conditioner out of the bedroom window, knowing that the mother had terminated their relationship and banned him from the house. Jennings v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 272 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 18, 2016). Review.  Because defendant did not argue, and neither party briefed the specific issues, the court of appeals decline to address his assignment of error as it was insuffic iently preserved; neither party addressed whether defendant intended to commit any misdemeanor except assault and battery or trespass, and thus, it was unclear whether he would have fulfilled the requirements for the crime with which he was charged, burg lary.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3B M.J. Cemeteries, § 8; 5C M.J. Dead Bodies, §§ 1, 3. CASE NOTES Construction.  Legislative intent of § 18.2-126 is to protect the sanctity of both a burial place and a dead body, wherever situated, and that is not the same intent encompas sed in § 18.2-48; the meaning of defile in subsection B of § 18.2-126 is not limited to the meaning of defile in § 18.2-48. Everett v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 14, 2020). Subsection B of § 18.2-126 excludes from the term defile any autopsy or recovery of organs or tissues for transplantation, or any other lawful purpose, which i s consistent with the ordinary meaning of defile as disrespecting or desecrating a corpse and inconsistent with interpreting the term as only sexual molestation; the only logical conclusion from defendants definition was that one performing an autops y was exempt from prosecution even if he sexually molested the corpse, and sexual molestation is not a legitimate purpose. Everett v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 14, 2020). Concealing a body under § 18.2-323.02 may occur without dishonoring or desecrating a corpse, the conduct addressed in subsection B of § 18.2-126; defendant attempted to prevent detection of the victims death by telling her family that she would return, even though he knew that she was dead and he had left her body in a city park, plus defendant told police that he last saw her when she left the house to buy drugs, but he did not admit that she had died in his bedroom that night. Everett v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 14, 2020). Meaning of defile in subsection B of § 18.2-126 is not limited to sexual molestation and includes any action that dishonors or desecrates a corpse by treating it in an offensive manner. Everett v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 14, 2020). Acts showing disrespect for body.  Contrary to defendants contention that his disposal of the victims corpse was not a physical act within the ambit of the statute, his actions of concealin g the body in bags and a rug and then dumping it in a filthy area of a park were physical acts that showed disrespect for the body. Everett v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 14, 2020). Evidence sufficient.  Defendant dumped the victims body in a garbage-strewn and filthy park, leaving it at the mercy of marauding animals that ultimately gnawed off part of her bod y; defendant purposely left her body in an area where harm to the sanctity of the body was foreseeable and ultimately caused such severe disfigurement that dental records were needed to identify the victim. Defendants actions clearly showed disrespec t for the corpse. Everett v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (Va. Ct.

Prosecution for breaking and entering and destroying private property not barred by § 19.2-294.  Section 19.2-294, which bars a prosecution for a violation of one statute if a defendant has been convicted of violation of another statute for the same act, is i napplicable where the same act involved was the breaking of the doors of the places broken into. This act, although common to both the convictions of breaking and entering and the convictions for destroying private property, was a violation of t his section, destroying private property, but was not a violation of § 18.2-91, statutory burglary. Thus, the same act was a violation of only one of the two statutes, not both. Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 625, 401 S.E.2d 208, 7 Va. Law R ep. 1528, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 19 (1991).

Criminal responsibility attaches to lawful act done in a criminally negligent manner.  Criminal responsibility under this section attaches when property is damaged or destroyed during the commission of an unlawful act, which includes the performance of a lawful act in a criminally negligent manner. Crowder v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 382, 429 S.E.2d 893, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1351, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 126, reinstated, 10 Va. Law Rep. 409 (Va. Ct. App. 1993). Interpretation regarding negligence.  Subsection B of § 18.2-137 attaches criminal liability when a person performs a volitional act that damages the property of another and the person specifically intends to cause damage to the property by that act. Subsection B does not criminalize the mere performance of a volitional act conducted in a criminally negligent manner that happens to damage the property of another. Scott v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. App. 35, 707 S.E.2d 17, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 104 (2011). Valuation of property.  Trial court properly convicted defendant of leaving the scene of an accident because there was no principled reason why the formula adopted by the Supreme Court o f Virginia in a civil context should not apply to a criminal prosecution when the amount of damage to a motor vehicle was an element of the offense, the property-destruction statute provided that the amount of loss to property could be established by pro of of the fair market cost of repair or fair market replacement value, and the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the reasonable cost of repairs to the damaged vehicle exceeded the $1,000 statutory threshold. Cocke v. Commonwe alth, 68 Va. App. 11, 801 S.E.2d 427, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 162 (2017). Commonwealth sufficiently established that the fair market replacement value of a grocery store scale defendant broke exceeded $1,000 for purposes of a felony des truction of personal property conviction because the term replacement contemplated the cost of obtaining a substitute item to take the place of the original, destroyed item; the inclusion of the term replacement in this statute allowed a specific inquiry into the value of the substitute item to establish the amount of loss; the grocery store purchased a scale for $4,090 to replace the broken scale; and the two models of scales  the replacement and the broken one  were virtually i dentical. Spratley v. Commonwealth, 69 Va. App. 314, 818 S.E.2d 823, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 268 (2018), aff'd, 298 Va. 187, 836 S.E.2d 385, 2019 Va. LEXIS 158 (2019). In a case in which defendant was convicted of felony destruction of property, the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the cost of repair for a broken window exceeded $1,000. Glass v. Commonwealth, 74 Va. App. 214, 867 S.E.2d 500, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 10 (2022). Cost of repair cannot be established through victims hearsay testimony as to estimate for repair.  In an action charging defendant with felony destruction of property, the victims hearsay testimony as to the estimated cost of repairing the damage to the vic tims truck did not suffice to establish the fair market cost of repairing the damage. Brown v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 27, 2009). Hearsay testimony as to repair costs.  Defendants conviction under this section was reversed as hearsay testimony of the repair costs for damage to the property was improperly admitted as the caret aker did not have personal knowledge of repair costs and testified to what the management company told him regarding the costs, and no exception to the hearsay rule applied; the exception to the hearsay rule in civil cases for affidavits estimating the c ost of repairing the damage to motor vehicles would not be necessary if the Virginia legislature thought that an owners testimony as to the value of property meant that the owner could testify to the estimated cost of repairs for property based upon third-party estimates. Gilliam v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 354 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 3, 2013), vacated in part, No. 1254-12-1, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 231 (Va. Ct. App. May 27, 2014).

CASE NOTES This section makes the offense consist of an act combined with a particular intent, and that intent cannot be presumed but must be proven. Thus an instruction to the effect that the law presumes a man to intend the natural and probable consequence of his act, and that if the accused struck a cow with a deadly weapon, the presumption of the law would be that he unlawfully intended to maim, disfigure and kill the cow, constituted error. Winckler v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1146, 156 S.E. 364, 1931 Va. LEXIS 291 (1931). Wounding in self-defense.  In a trial under this section it appeared from the evidence that the accused wounded a cow in an attempt to save himself or his own cow when charged by it. Accuse ds narrative was uncontradicted and was corroborated by other testimony. It was held that, giving to the testimony of the Commonwealth all the probative value to which it was entitled, it was wholly insufficient to sustain the verdict of guilty. Winc kler v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1146, 156 S.E. 364, 1931 Va. LEXIS 291 (1931). Sufficiency of evidence.  Sufficient evidence permitted the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed a firearm and shot a dog where defendant admitted driving by the site of the shooting on the day of the shooting, one of two girls saw defendant shoot a firearm toward the barn where they were playing with the dog, the other saw him with a firearm right after the shooting, and the girls were certain defendant was the man they saw at the barn with the firearm.

Defendant rendered assistance to his accomplice by handing him goat feed so that the accomplice could lure the goats to him, recorded the attack on his cell phone , and gleefully encouraged the perpetrators in their brutal attack by not only making suggestions for it but also laughingly encouraging their cruel attack on the small goats, and his convictions for maliciously maiming the livestock of another were uphe ld, as were his convictions for conspiring to maliciously maim the livestock of another.

The purpose of the federal sta tute is to provide protection for interstate and foreign shipments while in transit. Martin v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 298, 295 S.E.2d 890, 1982 Va. LEXIS 295 (1982). Construction of other property.  The term other property cannot be viewed in the abstract and construed broadly to mean any property, whether or not a part of a shipment. Under the rule of ejusdem generis, when a particular class of persons or things is enumerated in a statute and general words follow, the general words are to be restricted in their meaning to a sense analogous to the less general, particular words. Likew ise, according to the maxim noscitur a sociis (associated words) when general and specific words are grouped, the general words are limited by the specific and will be construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those things identified by the specific words. Martin v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 298, 295 S.E.2d 890, 1982 Va. LEXIS 295 (1982). While the meaning of other property does not encompass articles of personal property kept in private vehicles, other property does equate to shipm ents of things analogous to freight or express. Hairston v. Commonwealth, 19 Va. App. 487, 452 S.E.2d 872, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 27 (1995). Shipment applies to the term other property. Martin v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 298, 295 S.E.2d 890, 1982 Va. LEXIS 295 (1982). Section inapplicable to personal property kept in private automobile.  The statutory term other property is restricted in its meaning to shipments of things analogous to freight or express. The meaning does not encompass articles of personal property kept in a private automobile for sentimental reasons. Martin v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 298, 295 S.E.2d 890, 1982 Va. LEXIS 295 (1982). § 18.2-147.2. Devices for puncturing motor vehicle tires.

CASE NOTES Construction.  Interpretation of § 18.2-279 applied in case law is binding on the Court of Appeals of Virginia with regard to the use of the word at in § 18.2-154 in the c ontext of shoots at or shooting at. Jones v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 304, 808 S.E.2d 220, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 321 (2017), aff'd, 296 Va. 412, 821 S.E.2d 540, 2018 Va. LEXIS 174 (2018). Court of Appeals of Virginia holds that the prohibition of § 18.2-154 against shooting at a vehicle encompasses such a shooting when the shooter is also inside the vehicle when he or she shoots at it. Jones v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 304, 808 S.E.2d 220, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 321 (2017), aff'd, 296 Va. 412, 821 S.E.2d 540, 2018 Va. LEXIS 174 (2018). Interpreting § 18.2-154 to include firing shots while seated in a vehicle did not render § 18.2-286.1, barring firing shots while seated in a motor vehicle, superfluous because (1) the existence of a similar but not identical statutes did not alter a courts duty to construe a statute according to the statutes plain language, (2) the statutes were textually and conceptually different, despite some ov erlap between the conduct the statutes barred, and the fact that separate statutes overlapped in the statutes proscription of specific conduct did not detract from the statutes independent enforcement except when double jeopardy concerns were imp licated. Jones v. Commonwealth, 296 Va. 412, 821 S.E.2d 540, 2018 Va. LEXIS 174 (2018). Defendant was properly convicted of shooting at an occupied motor vehicle when defendant fired shots while seated in a vehicle because the statute had no requirem ent that a shooter who maliciously shoots at an occupied vehicle be positioned outside of the vehicle. Jones v. Commonwealth, 296 Va. 412, 821 S.E.2d 540, 2018 Va. LEXIS 174 (2018). This section was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant convicted of secon d degree murder thereafter. Willis v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 430, 393 S.E.2d 405, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2486, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 107 (1990). Court should have declined deciding whether portion of statute unconstitutionally vague.  The aspect of this section that would allegedly allow the judge or jury unfettered discretion to determine what constitutes first degree murder is severable from those provisions of the statute which define the offense of murder, which is deemed second degree. Thus, since defendant was not convicted of first degree murder, the court should have declined deciding whether that portion of the statute was unconstitu tionally vague. Willis v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 430, 393 S.E.2d 405, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2486, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 107 (1990). Legislative intent.  The legislature, when it enacted the predecessor to this section, clearly intended to make punishable as murder the killing of an occupant of a motor vehicle resu lting from a malicious shooting into the vehicle whereby the life of any person in the vehicle is put in peril. Willis v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 430, 393 S.E.2d 405, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2486, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 107 (1990). Predicate facts of an unlawful shooting at an occupied vehicle resulting in death would always constitute criminal negligence, and therefore, a person committing that offense is guilty of involuntary manslaughter; as the language of the statute is unambiguous, the courts are bound by the plain meaning of that language. Gregg v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 375, 796 S.E.2d 447, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 56 (2017), aff'd, 2 95 Va. 293, 811 S.E.2d 254, 2018 Va. LEXIS 34 (2018). Enactment of the statute did not make the punishment for involuntary manslaughter more severe, nor does it mitigate the punishment when the criminally negligent a ct leading to the death of an individual is shooting at an occupied vehicle; the statute simply creates a mechanism that permits the Commonwealth to substitute proof of distinct facts in place of criminal negligence. Gregg v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 37 5, 796 S.E.2d 447, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 56 (2017), aff'd, 295 Va. 293, 811 S.E.2d 254, 2018 Va. LEXIS 34 (2018). There is no evidence in the legislative history of the statute or case law that suggests the General Assembly intended to create an offense separate and distinct from common-law involuntary manslaughter, or to permit the Commonwealth to obtain multiple convictions and punishments under the statute and common law involuntary manslaughter for a single killing. Gregg v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 375, 796 S.E.2d 447, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 56 (2017), aff'd, 295 Va. 293, 811 S.E.2d 254, 2018 Va. LEXIS 34 (2018). Homicide under section is presumptively second degree murder.  In Virginia, every malicious killing is prima facie second degree murder, and the burden is on the commonwealth to elevate the grade of the offense to first degre e. Accordingly, a homicide resulting from maliciously shooting into an occupied vehicle is presumptively second degree murder. Willis v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 430, 393 S.E.2d 405, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2486, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 107 (1990). To constitute murder under this section, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed: (1) a malicious shooting, (2) at or against a motor vehicle, (3) when occupied by one or more persons, (4) whereby the life of any person in such motor vehicle may be put in peril, and (5) the death of any such person r esults therefrom. Willis v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 430, 393 S.E.2d 405, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2486, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 107 (1990). Murder under section does not preclude conviction under § 18.2-53.1.  Murder under this section accomplished by a malicious shooting does not preclude a conviction under § 18.2-53.1 for use of a firearm in the commission of murder. Willis v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 430, 393 S.E.2d 405, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2486, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 107 (1990). Allegation of violation of section sufficient to charge offenses proscribed by reference.  Although original indictment did not contain a separate averment that felonious shooting caused the death of an occupant of a vehicle, the allegation, that defend ants acts violated this section, incorporated the offenses proscribed therein by reference and was sufficient to charge him with those offenses which are proscribed by that section of the criminal code, including murder. Thus because the original i ndictment was sufficient to have prosecuted defendant for murder, an amendment adding language that the shooting resulted in the death of an occupant of the vehicle did not change the nature of character of the acts which the indictment alleged that defe ndant had committed. Willis v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 430, 393 S.E.2d 405, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2486, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 107 (1990). Assault not a lesser-included offense.  In a case in which defendant was convicted for unlawful shooting at an occupied vehicle, in violation of § 18.2-154, he unsuccessfully argued that double jeopa rdy barred his conviction, because he was previously tried and convicted of assault, arising out of the same events and assault was a lesser-included offense of unlawful shooting at an occupied vehicle. The plain language of § 18.2-154 simply did not require the intent to inflict bodily injury on the part of the accused, and, since the intent requirement was an essential element required to prove assault, assault was not a lesser-included offense in unlawful shooting at an occupied vehicle.

Sect ion does not affect liability of railroad to licensee.  In an action for death, it was contended that the decedent at the time of the accident could not be regarded as a licensee, because he was walking on the track, a nd this section makes it a misdemeanor for any person to be on a railroad track, except at a crossing, within 100 yards of a moving train. It was held that this section could not be given the effect contended for. To do so would deprive licensees of the protection which has always been accorded to them, there being many cases in which recoveries have been allowed to licensees who have been injured on the track while apparently violating this section.

CASE NOTES Evidence insufficient.  As the evidence was insufficient to show that defendant destroyed or disabled a cell phone, defendants conviction under subdivision B 2 of § 18.2-164 was i mproper; defendant did not disable or damage the victims cell phone, and the Commonwealth only claimed that the victim was unable to use the cell phone.

While the circuit court implicitly found that defendant disabled or destroyed the victims cell phone in convicting defendant of interfering with a 911 phone c all, it previously stated that it could not resolve an evidentiary dispute regarding who destroyed the victims cell phone, defendant or the victim. Therefore, the courts factual conclusion that the evidence did not establish that defendant disabl ed or destroyed the victims cell phone rendered the evidence legally insufficient to support defendants conviction. Wandemberg v. Commonwealth, 70 Va. App. 124, 825 S.E.2d 291, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (2019). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No evidence of obstruction or interference with private rights.  There were no grounds for removal of adjacent property owners structures and relocation of the owners pier so that it did not obstruct navigation or other wise injure private rights of other persons because the evidence did not support that the pier constituted an obstruction or violation of private rights; there was no demonstration by any evidence that the owners out pilings or the addition to their pier obstructed use of the neighbors pier or interfered with private rights.

CASE NOTES Intent to defraud is an element of the offense of forgery of public documents. Campbell v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 988, 421 S.E.2d 652, 9 Va. Law Rep. 97, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 214 (1992), aff'd in part, 246 Va. 174, 431 S.E.2d 648, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1505, 1993 Va. LEXIS 101 (1993). Offense is again st public in general or government.  It is readily apparent that violation of any of the forgery statutes other than § 18.2-172 is an offense against the public in general or, as in this case, the government itself. Campbell v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 33, 409 S.E.2d 21, 8 Va. Law Rep. 743, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 249 (1991). Public record means, but is not limited to, all written books, papers, letters, documents, photographs, tapes, microfiche, microfilm, photostats, sound recordings, maps, other documentary materials or information in any recording medium regardless of physical form or characteristics, including electronically recorded data, made or r eceived in pursuance of law or in connection with the transaction of public business by any agency or employee of state government or its political subdivisions. Hall v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 287 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 18, 2000). Section 18.2-168 plainly states that a person is guilty of forgery of a public document if he forges a public record, not public records generally. Hines v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 752, 576 S.E.2d 781, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 92 (2003). A public record must be a written memorial, intended to serve as evidence of something w ritten, said or done, made by a public officer authorized by law to make it, but that authority need not be derived from express statutory enactment. Coleman v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 865, 1874 Va. LEXIS 86 (1874), overruled, Campbell v. Common wealth, 246 Va. 174, 431 S.E.2d 648, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1505, 1993 Va. LEXIS 101 (1993). Includes record of transactions of public officer.  Whenever a written record of the transactions of a public officer, in his office, is a convenient and appropriate mode of discharging the duties of his office, it is not only his right but his duty to keep that written memorial, whether expressly required so to do or not; and when kept it becomes a public document, a public record, belonging to the office and not the officer. Coleman v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. (25 G ratt.) 865, 1874 Va. LEXIS 86 (1874), overruled, Campbell v. Commonwealth, 246 Va. 174, 431 S.E.2d 648, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1505, 1993 Va. LEXIS 101 (1993). Such as warrant book of sinking fund.  The warrant book of the sinking fund, kept by the (then) second auditor in his office, of the transactions of the (then) commissioners of the sinking fund of the state, is such a public record that it may be the subject of forgery. Coleman v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 865, 1874 Va. LEXIS 86 (1874), overruled, Campbell v. Commonwealth, 246 Va. 174, 431 S.E.2d 648, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1505, 1993 Va. LEXIS 101 (19 93). The trial court correctly concluded that each praecipe was a forged public record, purpo rtedly documenting the Commonwealths motion to nolle prosequi a pending criminal prosecution, clearly the pursuit of public business by a public officer; thus defendants actions involving the praecipes supported his convictions. C hellman v. Commonwealth, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 157 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 25, 1997). A confirmation of insurance document was a public record for purposes of this section in that it was completed in part by a police officer, was used by the police and the DMV, as agents of the Commonwealth, to ascertain whether the vehicle was properly insured as required by state law and the officer kept a duplicate original for a governme ntal and public purpose. Hall v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 287 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 18, 2000). Forgery during jail intake.  Where defendant, during initial intake following his arrest on criminal charges, forged fingerprint card and jail classification cards, and made statements promp ted by deputys questions, such questions were biographical in nature and part of routine booking procedure, and Miranda warnings were not required. Watts v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 206, 562 S.E.2d 699, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 250 (2002). Jail intake records.  Court of appeals declined to apply the ends of justice exception to defendants claim that certain documents were not public records within the meaning of § 18.2-168 because jail/annex property issued/returned sheets, police department advice of rights forms, advice of right form, and written statement to the police were all public records; those documents were made in connection with transaction of public business, admitting a prisoner to jail and investigating a crime, and were made by an authorized public officer to serve as evidence of things that were written, said or done, the receipt of defendants personal property at the jail and the distributi on of jail property to defendant in the context of the property records, or legal proof that defendant had been advised of his Miranda rights and had given a statement to the police. Word v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 330 (Va. Ct. App. July 21, 20 09). Fingerprint card is clearly a public record. Greene v. Commonwealth, No. 1824-94-4 (Ct. of Appeals May 30, 1995). Traffic summons was forged public record.  Traffic summons before the court was clearly a forged public record which could be received as legal proof, a writing expressly proscribed by this section. Blake v. Commonwealth, No. 2872-96-1 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 20, 1998). Traffic summons was a public record as it became the charging document on which a general district court tried an accused, under § 16.1-129, and if an accused willfully violated his written promise to appear in court, given when he signed the summons, he could be convicted for failure to appear under § 19.2-128, regardless of the disposition of, and in addition to, the charge upon which he was originally ar rested, under § 19.2-74 A 3, and, given this statutory scheme, each signed summons clearly could constitute a separate offense under § 18.2-168, regarding forgery of a public document. Hines v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 752, 576 S.E.2d 781, 2003 Va . App. LEXIS 92 (2003). When defendant signed five separate summonses, issued at the same time, for five separate traffic infractions with his brothers name, the single larceny d octrine did not apply to make him guilty of only one forgery. Hines v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 752, 576 S.E.2d 781, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 92 (2003). Forged public documents: vehicle title and operators license.  Evidence showed the defendant uttered a forged public document where he used faked names and records to obtain an operators license and an application for a v ehicle title and then injured an officer attempting to flee. Mohamed v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (Va. Ct. App. May 6, 2003). Where evidence showed the defendant forged his brothers signature to prolong his deception of being the person whose license was given to an officer, or the p erson whose license was suspended was given notice, conviction for forgery was proper. Brown v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 297 (Va. Ct. App. May 13, 2003). Community se rvice attendance sheet is public record.  Sufficient evidence supported defendants convictions of forgery and uttering a public record, as the evidence in defendants case showed that defendant add ed hours to a community service attendance sheet to show that defendant had performed all of defendants court-ordered community service when in fact defendant had not done so; the attendance sheet qualified as a required public record to support defe ndants conviction because the evidence showed that it was a document the probation officer collected pursuant to the duties that the county imposed upon her in supervising individuals on probation and the evidence also showed that defendant had added hours to it that defendant had not worked despite the fact that the sheet said not to write on it and that doing so would amount to forgery, a felony. Koch v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 3 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 9, 2007). Juvenile and domestic relations district court guilty plea form not a public record.  Court of appeals invoked the ends of justice exception to defendants claim that the trial court erred in convicting him of forging a juvenile and domestic rel ations district court guilty plea form because a miscarriage of justice took place, and defendant showed affirmative evidence in the record establishing that an element of the offense of forging a public document did not exist and that he did not commit the crime of forging a public record; the juvenile and domestic relations district court guilty plea form was not a public record because it was not prepared in connection with a legitimate legal proceeding, and that form was replaced with a general dist rict court form before final judgment was entered in the general district court. Word v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 330 (Va. Ct. App. July 21, 2009). Ends of justice exception should have been invoked where erroneous jury instruction was so defective that it allowed the jury to convict defendant of forgery even if the jury concluded that defendant lacked an intent to defraud. Intent to defraud, however, is a necessary element of forgery. Campbell v.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 5A M.J. Counterfeiting, § 2; 8B M.J. Forgery §§ 2, 7, 25. CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  The difference in classification of the offense of forgery and uttering embodied in this section and § 18.2-172 is not arbitrary and unreasonable, because ther e are logical reasons for the distinction; thus, the sections are not unconstitutional. Tedder v. Cox, 317 F. Supp. 33, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10369 (W.D. Va. 1970). Brightening base pieces is criminal.  One who brightens base pieces (which are brought to him ready formed, with the impression and appearance of dollars, except that they are of a dark color, like le ad, and not then passable), by boiling them in a lye, and rubbing them with woolen cloth, and subjecting them to other processes, thereby rendering them by resemblance to real dollars more fit for circulation, is guilty of counterfeiting. Rasnick v. Comm onwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 356 (1823). As is passing forged note of defun ct bank.  It is felony to pass a counterfeit note of the bank of the United States, dated at a time when that bank was in existence, though, at the time of passing the note , the charter of the bank had expired. Buckland v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 732, 1837 Va. LEXIS 48 (1837). But passing must be with guilty knowledge.  The passing of a counterfeit note may be of itself a perfectly innocent transaction; the guilt consists in passing it knowing it to be counterfeit. Finn v. Common wealth, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 701, 1827 Va. LEXIS 36 (1827); Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 266, 246 S.E.2d 899, 1978 Va. LEXIS 187 (1978). For a defendant to be convicted of uttering a counterfeit bill, the evidence must not only show that he passed counterfeit currency, it must also show that he kne w it to be counterfeit at the time he passed it. Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 266, 246 S.E.2d 899, 1978 Va. LEXIS 187 (1978). Time and place of passing and scienter sufficiently certain.  Where an indictment for passing a counterfeit note charges that the prisoner, on a particular day, at the county of M. and within the jurisdiction of the court, b eing possessed of the note, feloniously did pass the same, well knowing it to be counterfeit at the time he passed it, the time and place of passing the note and of the scienter are set forth with sufficient certainty. Buckland v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 732, 1837 Va. LEXIS 48 (1837). Which must be proved.  In a prosecution for uttering counterfeit coin, the guilty knowledge of the prisoner that the coin was counterfeit is a fact to be proved. Wash v. Commonwealth, 5 7 Va. (16 Gratt.) 530, 1861 Va. LEXIS 11 (1861). Evidence that prisoner passed other counterfeit notes admissible to show scienter.  On the trial of an indictment for passing a counterfeit bank note or check, after evidence that the prisoner passed the note, and that it was counterfeit, evidenc e that the prisoner had in his possession and attempted to pass other counterfeit notes of the same kind to other persons, the day after he passed those in the indictment mentioned, is admissible to prove the scienter. Hendrick v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. 70 8 (1834) (see Martin v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 745 (1830)). Indictment valid which contains several charges in one count.  An indictment which charges a prisoner with the offenses of falsely making, forging and counterfeiting; of causing and procuring to be falsely made, forged and co unterfeited, and of willingly acting and assisting in the said false making, forging and counterfeiting, is a good indictment, though all of these charges are contained in a single count. The words of the statute being pursued, and there being a general verdict of guilty, judgment ought not to be arrested on the ground that the offenses are distinct. Rasnick v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 356 (1823). Or w hich does not state how accused caused note to be passed.  An indictment for causing and procuring a counterfeited bank note to be offered to be passed, without stating by whom or how the accused caused and procured it to be done, is sufficiently certain, and good. Brown v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 769, 1839 Va. LEXIS 1 (1839). Or which does not state a late r indorsement.  In setting out counterfeit bank note in haec verba, in an indictment for feloniously passing the same, an indorsement appearing to have been made on the note afte r it was passed is properly omitted and the omission is therefore no ground for the objection of variance. Buckland v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 732, 1837 Va. LEXIS 48 (1837). Or that it was to the prejudice of another.  Upon an indictment of passing a counterfeit note of a bank, without alleging that the bank is a chartered bank, or that there is no such bank, and without allegin g that the note was passed to the prejudice of anothers rights, or for the prisoners own benefit, or for the benefit of another, it was held that the offense so charged is a felony, and the indictment is good and sufficient. Murry v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 720, 1835 Va. LEXIS 2 (1835) (see Commonwealth v. Ervin, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 337 (1823)). Or that injury was intended.  A charge that a forgery of bank notes was committed with intent to injure divers good citizens of the Commonwealth, and others, to the jurors unknown, wit hout setting out an intent to injure the president, directors of those banks, or of any particular person, or body politic, by name, is good after verdict. Commonwealth v. Ervin, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 337 (1823). It is not necessary to produce the coin to convict one of passing a counterfeit coin. Kir k v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 627, 1838 Va. LEXIS 52 (1838). Evidence of the passing of counterfeit notes by a confederate.  Upon the trial of an indictment for passing counterfeit bank notes, the prisoner appears clearly to have been confederated with another in passing counterfeit not es, and present when such notes were passed; the notes so passed may be produced in evidence against the prisoner. Martin v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 745, 1830 Va. LEXIS 72 (1830). Evidence that a confederate, in the defendants presence, passed counterfeit notes of the same description on other occasions is admissible against the defenda nt to prove scienter or guilty knowledge on his part. Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 266, 246 S.E.2d 899, 1978 Va. LEXIS 187 (1978). Evidence sufficient to show knowledg e.  Given defendants conduct in repeatedly attempting to get counterfeit bills back from the cashier to whom he had given the bills, the physical appearance of th e bills which immediately identified them to the cashier, the store manager, and the investigating officer as counterfeit, and defendants inconsistent statements to the cashier and the officer as to how he obtained the bills, a rational fact finder c ould reasonably have inferred that defendant knew the bills were counterfeit when he passed them to the cashier. Pratt v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 595 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2006). Evidence was sufficient to prove the intent necessary to support a conviction for uttering where the jury was permitted to infer defendants guilty knowledge f rom his possession of forged travelers checks, where defendant provided conflicting accounts as to how he obtained the checks, and after defendant obtained the checks, he immediately negotiated each check for an inexpensive item and a large amount of cash. Richardson v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 84 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 9, 2010). Presumptive eviden ce that accused was the forger.  Upon the trial of an indictment for forging bank notes the fact, if proved, of the forged notes mentioned in the indictment, and other forged notes of like kind, and the plates, implements and materials for forging such notes being found in the prisoners possession is prima facie or circumstantial presumptive evidence that the prisoner was the forger, proper to be given to the jury. Spencer v. Commonwealth, 2 9 Va. (2 Leigh) 751, 1830 Va. LEXIS 73 (1830). State court has jurisdiction when act also constitutes federal offense.  A state court has jurisdiction to punish the offense of attempting to pass a forged note purporting to be a note of one of the national banks of the United States , though the offense is contrary to a law of the Congress of the United States. Jet v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 933, 1867 Va. LEXIS 37 (1867) (see also Hendrick v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 707 (1834)). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Applicability.  Because a personal check does not fall within the limited scope of writings covered by § 18.2-168 or § 18.2-170, the forgery of a blank personal check or th e uttering of a forged check constitutes a violation of § 18.2-172.

CASE NOTES Adapted and designed defined .  Adapted means capable of being used; fit or suitable. Designed means appropriate, fit, prepared, or suitable; also adapted, designated , or intended. Smith v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 10, 55 S.E.2d 427, 1949 Va. LEXIS 256 (1949). Such person in the second portion of this section refers to any person i n the first portion thereof. Smith v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 10, 55 S.E.2d 427, 1949 Va. LEXIS 256 (1949). Any such plate, block, press, or other thing, the possession of which is condemn ed by the second portion of the section, is such a device or instrumentality the making or mending of which is condemned by the first portion  that is, such as is adapted and designed for the forging and false making of any writing. Smith v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 10, 55 S.E.2d 427, 1949 Va. LEXIS 256 (1949). This section condemns either the making or mending of, or the possession of, the instrumentality for an unlawful purpose. It is immaterial that it was originally planned, constructed and intended to be used for a lawful purpose. Smith v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 10, 55 S.E.2d 427, 1949 Va. LEXIS 256 (1949). What this section condemns is either the making or mending or the possession of the instrumentality for an evil or unlawful purpose. Hanbury v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 182, 122 S.E.2d 911, 1961 Va. LEXIS 238 (1961). Proof of intent by maker or mender not needed.  Proof of intent that it be used for forgery, on the part of one who makes or mends a check-writing machine, is not necessary to sustain a conviction of unlawful p ossession of the instrumentality in the hands of another. Smith v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 10, 55 S.E.2d 427, 1949 Va. LEXIS 256 (1949). Possession of rubber stamp for marking city tax paid on cigarette packages.  See Hanbury v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 182, 122 S.E.2d 911, 1961 Va. LEXIS 238 (1961). Indictment insufficient.  An indictment charging that the prisoner did knowingly have in his custody, without lawful authority or excuse, one die or instrument for the purpose of p roducing and impressing the stamp and similitude of the current silver coin called a half dollar (no further describing the die or instrument), is insufficient. Commonwealth v. Scott, 40 Va. 695, 1942 Va. LEXIS 42 (1842). Sufficiency of evidence.  When accused was arrested following his purchase of a check-writing machine, he had in his possession blank checks bearing a companys printed name and the for ged signature of an official of the company. The Commonwealth proved that on the day before his arrest he had cashed a forged check of the company. It was held that this evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction under the second portion of this s ection. Smith v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 10, 55 S.E.2d 427, 1949 Va.

Constitutionality.  The difference in classification of the offense of forgery and uttering embodied in § 18.2-170 and this section is not arbitrary and unreasonable, because ther e are logical reasons for the distinction; thus, the sections are not unconstitutional. Tedder v. Cox, 317 F. Supp. 33, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10369 (W.D. Va. 1970). Violation of forgery statutes other than this section is offens e against public or government.  It is readily apparent that violation of any of the forgery statutes other than this section is an offense against the public in general or the government itself. Campbell v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 33, 409 S.E.2d 21, 8 Va. Law Rep. 743, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 249 (1991). The language to the prejudice of anothers right appears only in this section and this statute expressly excludes § 18.2-168, which criminalizes the forging of public documents; therefore, the legislature did not intend that the prejudice to anothers right requirement be in any other sections. Campbell v. Commonwea lth, 13 Va. App. 33, 409 S.E.2d 21, 8 Va. Law Rep. 743, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 249 (1991). Evidence held insufficient to prove venue.  Defendants two grand larceny and two uttering a forged check convictions were reversed on appeal, as the trial court erred in finding the evidence insufficien t to establish venue, no evidence was presented by the Commonwealth as to the location of the alleged crimes, and the Commonwealth failed to ask the court to take judicial notice of that location. Harris v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 493 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 31, 2006). Evidence held sufficient to prove venue.  Trial court did not err in convicting defendant of forgery in violation of § 18.2-172 because venue was proper in Mecklenburg County, Virginia since the eviden ce established a strong presumption that defendant deposited or placed the forged instrument with another person or firm in Mecklenburg County pursuant to § 19.2-245.1, and the record did not suggest the involvement of an alternate jurisdiction from w hich defendant could reasonably have perpetrated the forgery; the victims attorney sent an unsigned note to defendants residence in Mecklenburg County, and although the record was silent as to who received the note, the only logical inference flo wing from the evidence was that defendant passed the instrument back to either the victim, who resided in Mecklenburg, or the attorney, whose principal place of business was also in Mecklenburg. Duckworth v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 60 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2011). II.Elements of Forgery. A.In General. Forgery defined.  Forgery is the making of a false writing which, if genuine, would be apparently of legal efficacy. Terry v. Commonwealth, 87 Va. 672, 13 S.E. 104, 1891 Va. LEXIS 120 (1891). Forgery is the false making or materially altering with intent to defraud, of any writing which, if genuine, might apparently be of legal efficacy, or the foundat ion of legal liability. Bullock v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 558, 138 S.E.2d 261, 1964 Va. LEXIS 218 (1964), cert. denied, Bullock v. Virginia, 382 U.S. 927, 86 S. Ct. 310, 15 L. Ed. 2d 341, 1965 U.S. LEXIS 232 (1965); Bateman v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 595, 1 39 S.E.2d 102, 1964 Va. LEXIS 223 (1964); Moore v. Commonwealth, 207 Va. 838, 153 S.E.2d 231, 1967 Va. LEXIS 143 (1967); Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 171, 313 S.E.2d 394, 1984 Va. LEXIS 278 (1984). Forgery is the fraudulent making or alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another mans right. Bullock v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 558, 138 S.E.2d 261, 1964 Va. LEXIS 218 (1964), cert. denied, Bullock v. Virginia, 382 U.S. 927, 86 S. Ct. 310, 15 L. Ed. 2d 341, 1965 U.S. LEXIS 232 (1965). Forgery is the false making or materially altering with intent to defraud, of any writing which, if genuine, might apparently be of legal efficacy, or the foundat ion of legal liability. Gordon v. Commonwealth, No. 1717-88-1 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 10, 1990). While a person may adopt any name he may choose so long as it was done for an honest purpose, forgery is committed by signing an assumed name, or a fictitious nam e, for a dishonest purpose and with intent to defraud. Moore v. Commonwealth, 207 Va. 838, 153 S.E.2d 231, 1967 Va. LEXIS 143 (1967). To sustain a forgery conviction, the Commonwealth had to prove that the accused falsely made or materially altered a writing, without the authority to do so, and did so to the prejudice of anothers right. Manas v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 524 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 25, 2001). Materiality.  A fact is material when it influences a person to enter into a contract, when it deceives him and induces him to act, or when without it, the transaction would no t have occurred. Beiler v. Commonwealth, 243 Va. 291, 415 S.E.2d 849, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2207, 1992 Va. LEXIS 13 (1992). It made no difference that appellants alterations of the checks did not change the banks contract with check writer. Appellants fraudulent alterations were material because they induced the tellers to pay the larger amounts shown on the checks. Beiler v. Commonwealth, 243 Va. 291, 415 S.E.2d 849, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2207, 1992 Va. LEXIS 13 (1992). Extent of defendant s participation.  It is immaterial whether the defendant actually cashed the checks, or whether they were forged by one person, endorsed by the defendant, and cashed by the forger or by a third person, where the defendants participation in the concerted action, and his fraudulent intent, are sufficiently supported by the evidence. Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 171, 313 S.E.2d 394, 1984 Va. LEXIS 278 (1984). Presence or absence at time of forgery.  One who procures the forgery of an instrument is an accessory before the fact if he was absent when the writing was forged, or a principal in the second degree if he was present. The distinction is of no consequence, because his guilt is the same, and he is subject to the same punishment, in either event. Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 171, 313 S.E.2d 394, 1984 Va. LEXIS 278 (1984). Writings, invalid on their face, are not subjects of forgery. If intrinsic circumstances are essential to the efficacy of the instrument, they must be averred in the indictment. Terry v. Commonwealth, 87 Va. 672, 13 S.E. 104, 1891 Va. LEXIS 120 (1891). But writing of q uestionable validity is.  A bail bond taken by a sheriff which has been altered in a material part may be the subject of a prosecution for forgery, although some doubts may be raised respe cting the validity of the bond, arising from the recitals in the condition. Commonwealth v. Linton, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 476 (1825). Writing must be to the prejudice of another.  This section predicates the offense of forgery only of such writings as are, or may be, to the prejudice of another. Terry v. Commonwealth, 87 Va. 672, 13 S.E. 10 4, 1891 Va. LEXIS 120 (1891). Or have a po ssibility of being prejudicial.  An instrument is one of legal efficacy, within the rules relating to forgery, where by any possibility, it may operate to the injury of another. Gordon v. Commonw ealth, 100 Va. 825, 41 S.E. 746, 1902 Va. LEXIS 90 (1902); Hanbury v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 182, 122 S.E.2d 911, 1961 Va. LEXIS 238 (1961). Proof of actual prejudice not necessary.  This section does not require that the Commonwealth prove beyond a reasonable doubt that someone, in fact, was prejudiced by appellants conduct. Rather, a con viction may be sustained where the evidence shows the possibility that the forged instrument may operate to the prejudice of anothers right. Mitchell v. Commonwealth, No. 2528-92-2 (Ct. of Appeals June 7, 1994). This section does not require that the forged or altered document operate to the actual prejudice of one who does or could rely on the genuineness of the document itself, but rather only that the forged document had the potential to operate to the prejudice of another. Stevenson v. Commonwealth, 27 Va. App. 453, 499 S.E.2d 580, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 303 (1998). When defendant was prosecuted for forgery for making false entries in a nursing home patients record, the Commonwealth did not have to show that anyone was ac tually prejudiced because the statute only required proof that a forged instrument might operate to the prejudice of anothers right.

CASE NOTES Felo nious possession of forged coin is a distinct offense.  The forging of a coin, and the felonious having in possession of such forged coin, are distinct and substantive offenses. Scott v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. (14 Gratt. ) 687, 1858 Va. LEXIS 58 (1858). And a prisoner examined for forgery cannot be indicted under this section.  A prisoner is examined for forging and counterfeiting 24 pieces of silver coin, and is sent on to the circuit court for further trial. He cannot be indicted for f eloniously having in his possession 10 or more pieces of coin, with intent to alter and employ the same as true. Scott v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 687, 1858 Va. LEXIS 58 (1858). Indictment for the felony must allege possession at the same time.  An indictment under the statute, for feloniously having in his possession more than 10 pieces of forged or base coin, must allege that the prisoner had them in hi s possession at the same time; and the charge that on a certain day he had them in his possession is not sufficient. Scott v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 687, 1858 Va. LEXIS 58 (1858). Intent to utter.  Evidence that defendant possessed forged notes in a pool hall, where cash transactions are common, allowed the fact finder to draw the common sense conclusion tha t he possessed the counterfeit currency with the intent to utter it, rather than for some other purpose. Hawkins v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 299 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2013), aff'd, 288 Va. 482, 764 S.E.2d 81, 2014 Va. LEXIS 148 (2014). Circumstances were sufficient to support an inference that defendant had the requisite intent to utter the counterfeit money in his possession, given that he was shown to possess counterfeit currency having a facial value of $ 360, he had taken the money to a pool hall, where cash transactions could be anticipated, and if he had any genuine currency with him, it was obviously segregated from the counterfeit bills he threw to the floor. Hawkins v. Commonwealth, 288 Va. 482, 764 S.E.2d 81, 2014 Va. LEXIS 148 (2014). Defendant claimed that if he brought counterfeit bills to the pool hall to pay gambling debts or buy drugs, he would have lacked the intent to employ them as true , but this was not a reasonable hypothesis of innocence that the evidence failed to exclude; when counterfeit currency was put into circulation, even if for an illegal purpose, someone would be defrauded by its use. Hawkins v. Commonwealth, 288 Va. 482, 764 S.E.2d 81, 2014 Va. LEXIS 148 (2014). Knowledge.  Circuit court could have drawn the inference that defendant knew the bills were counterfeit, given that he threw the bills on the floor and denied they were his. Hawkins v. Commonwealth, 288 Va. 482, 764 S.E.2d 81, 2014 Va. LEXIS 148 (2014). Sufficient circumstantial evidence supported conviction.  Sufficient circumstantial evidence that defendant knew that the currency was counterfeit supported defendants § 18.2-173 conviction where: (1) defendant di d not disclaim knowledge that the bills were counterfeit; (2) he admitted that he obtained the counterfeit currency from a friend; (3) he told a deputy that the $20 bills were the only counterfeit money he had; (4) he attempted to conceal his identity by giving the deputy false identification, which was evidence of guilty knowledge; and (5) the fraudulent nature of the bills was apparent to the deputy, who had no training in detecting counterfeit currency. Siharath v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 1 22 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 16, 2013). Sufficient circumstantial evidence that defendant intended to utter or employ the counterfeit currency as true supported defendants § 18.2-173 conviction w here: (1) he segregated his counterfeit currency from his genuine currency, the purpose of which was to enable the possessor to readily distinguish it from the genuine currency; (2) defendant had been unemployed for two years with no readily identifiable source of income; (3) he was traveling to a location commonly known for gambling and recreational activities; and (4) it could reasonably be concluded that defendant was carrying the $200 in counterfeit currency to supplement his $130 in genuine currenc y to pay his trip expenses. Siharath v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 122 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 16, 2013). Sufficiency of evidence.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of possessing 10 or more forged bank notes while knowing they were forged, as it established that when he saw police officers, he pulled 18 counterfeit $20 bills from his pocket and threw them on the floor; this evidence proved he possessed the notes and allowed the fact finder to infer that he knew they were forged. Hawkins v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 299 (Va . Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2013), aff'd, 288 Va. 482, 764 S.E.2d 81, 2014 Va. LEXIS 148 (2014). Sergeant testified he watched while defendant removed his right hand from his pocket, that his hand held the money in question, and that he threw the money to the floor, and the trial court found the sergeant to be credible, and this alone was sufficient to support a finding that defendant possessed the bills, for purposes of his possession of counterfeit currency conviction.

A second or subsequent offense is punishable as a Class 6 felony. History History. Code 1950, § 18.1-311; 1960, c. 358; 1975, cc. 14, 15; 2013, c c. 410, 431, 638. Annotations Editors note. Acts 2013, c. 431, cl. 3 provides: That the provisions of this act shall not become effective unless an appropriation of general funds effectuating the purpo ses of this act is included in a general appropriation act passed by the 2013 Session of the General Assembly, which becomes law. Acts 2013, c. 431, cl. 4 provides: That the General Assembly determines that the requirements of the third enactment of this act have been met. The 2013 amendments. The 2013 amendments by cc. 410 and 638 are identical, and rewrote the section which read: Any person who shall falsely assume or exercise the functions, power s, duties and privileges incident to the office of sheriff, police officer, marshal, or other peace officer, or who shall falsely assume or pretend to be any such officer, shall be deemed guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The 2013 amendment by c. 431 rewrote the section. The section has been set out in the form above at the direction of the Virginia Code Commission. Law Review. For article on model abusive debt collection statute for Virginia, see 15 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 567 (1974). CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  This section was not facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment because: (1) the Virginia impersonation statute had a plainly legitimate sweep where by p rotecting unsuspecting citizens from those who falsely pretend to be law-enforcement officers, the statute served the Commonwealths critical interest in public safety, and the second clause prohibited dangerous conduct, such as pretending to be a law -enforcement officer in order to board an airplane, that might not fall under the first clause; and (2) defendant was right at the core of the Virginia impersonation statutes plainly legitimate sweep since there was no question that defendant tried t o dodge a traffic ticket by falsely assuming or pretending to be a law-enforcement officer. United States v. Chappell, 691 F.3d 388, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 16990 (4th Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1136, 133 S. Ct. 965, 184 L. Ed. 2d 748, 2013 U.S. LEX IS 657 (2013). Under the overbreadth analysis, a law that restricts speech may be invalidated only if its realistic unconstitutional applications are substantial, not only in an absolute sense, but also relative to the statutes plainly legitimate sweep. Neither condition is satisfied with respect to § 18.2-174 since the statutes legitimate sweep was considerable. United States v. Chappell, 691 F.3d 388, 2012 U.S. App . LEXIS 16990 (4th Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1136, 133 S. Ct. 965, 184 L. Ed. 2d 748, 2013 U.S. LEXIS 657 (2013). Fugitive recovery agent ex ceeded authority.  Evidence was sufficient to convict a fugitive recovery agent in connection with his stop of a vehicle in which he thought a fugitive might be riding, as he exceed ed the scope of the authority granted him under § 19.2-149 by: (1) wearing a misleading badge representing that he was part of a special investigations unit of a law-enforcement body; (2) stating that he was with a violent crimes unit ; and (3) interrogating the woman he stopped about her possible drunk driving after he realized that the fugitive was not in the car. English v. Commonwealth, 43 Va. App. 370, 598 S.E.2d 322, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 294 (2004). In this 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 action, defendant was denied summary judgment as to the Fourth Amendment claim because no prudent person in defendants position could conclude, even on the basis of a reasonable mistake in interpreting or applying the law, that probable cause existed to arrest plaintiff for violating § 18.2-174 under the specific constellation of facts in this record. Merchant v. Fairfax Count y, 778 F. Supp. 2d 636, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39862 (E.D. Va. 2011), aff'd, 677 F.3d 656, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 8469 (4th Cir. 2012). Probable cause.  Where an arrestee was arrested for impersonating a police officer under § 18.2-174 based on a conversation with an officer, the officer was properly denied sum mary judgment based on qualified immunity as to an unlawful seizure claim because there was a lack of probable cause since the arrestee accurately related to the officer that the arrestee was a deputy director of the county department of corrections and that the arrestee worked in public safety, the arrestee referred to the arrestees county-issued vehicle as a police car by using air quotes, and the arrestee carried a lawfully-issued badge. Merchant v. Bauer, 677 F.3d 656, 2012 U.S. App. LEX IS 8469 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1068, 133 S. Ct. 789, 184 L. Ed. 2d 582, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 9564 (2012). Evidence.  Sufficient evidence supported a conviction for falsely pretending to be a police officer because police paraphernalia seized from defendants car was admissibl e to prove intent and defendant flashed emergency lights while operating a vehicle that looked like an unmarked police vehicle in a manner similar to that of a police officer making a traffic stop.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Private militias.  A group of private militia members coming as a unit, heavily armed with assault-style weapons, dressed in fatigues and other military accessories, and acting in a coordinated fashion  patrolling a line of citizens waiting to engage with legislators and projecting authority to manage the crowd  can constitute a violation of impersonating law-enforcement officers.

False Pretenses and Cheats, §§ 1-3; 12A M.J. L arceny, §§ 2, 4, 19. CASE NOTES Analysis I. General Considerations. II. Evidentiary Matters. I.General Considerations. In general.  Under Virginia law, embezzlement, false pretenses, and larceny are three separate offenses and there is not a general theft statute, as there is in most s tates, that encompasses both types of behavior, and § 18.2-95 defines grand larceny; § 18.2-111 defines embezzlement; and § 18.2-178 defines false pretenses. The Commonwealth of Virginia has always purported to treat the three basic theft crimes of larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses as separate and distinct offenses, and maintains separate statutes for each crime. United States v. Good, 326 F.3d 589, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 7543 (4th Cir. 2003). Obtaining by false pretense may be shown under indictment for larceny.  It is the settled law of Virginia that upon an indictment simply charging larceny the state may show that the subject of the larceny was obtained by a false token or pretense. Dowdy v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 727, 1852 Va. LEXIS 70 (1852); Leftwich v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 716, 1870 Va. LEXIS 7 (1870); Anable v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 563, 1873 Va. LEXIS 14 (1873); Fay v. Commonwealth , 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 912, 1877 Va. LEXIS 112 (1877); Trogdon v. Commonwealth, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 862, 1878 Va. LEXIS 44 (1878); Lewis v. Commonwealth, 120 Va. 875, 91 S.E. 174, 1917 Va. LEXIS 169 (1917) (see also Hoback v. Commonwealth, 69 Va. (28 Gratt. ) 922 (1877); Anthony v. Commonwealth, 88 Va. 847, 14 S.E. 834 (1892); Pitsnogle v. Commonwealth, 91 Va. 808, 22 S.E. 351 (1895); Mangus v. McClelland, 93 Va. 786, 22 S.E. 364 (1895)). Proof that the accused obtained money by false pretenses will sustain an indictment for larceny. Bateman v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 595, 139 S.E.2d 102, 1964 Va. LE XIS 223 (1964); Bourgeois v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 268, 227 S.E.2d 714, 1976 Va. LEXIS 270 (1976). Every element of offense must be proved.  Although this section makes false pretenses equivalent to larceny, yet one cannot be found guilty under a simple count charging him with larceny any more than und er one charging specifically the offense of obtaining money, etc., by false pretenses, if there is wanting in the proof any of those elements which constitute that offense. Anable v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 563, 1873 Va. LEXIS 14 (1873) (see als o Fay v. Commonwealth, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 912 (1877); Trogdon v. Commonwealth, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 862 (1878)). Where the Commonwealth failed to prove larceny by false pretenses the conviction cannot be upheld on grounds that the evidence at trial was sufficient to sustain a conviction of the common-law crime of larceny by trick and that the jury instruction set forth all the elements of this crime. An accused is entitled to be clearly informed of the charge against him. The Commonwealth cannot retrospectively argue that d efendant should be convicted of a crime for which he was not prosecuted, and on which the jury was not instructed. Baker v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 192, 300 S.E.2d 788, 1983 Va. LEXIS 208 (1983). Because salesperson knew that suit was stolen when defendant returned it for cash, evidence failed to prove that any store employee was induced by false pretenses to pay money. Gaines v. Commonwealth, No. 1354-98-4 (Ct. of Appeals July 6, 1999). Elements of offense.  To constitute the statutory offense of obtaining money under false pretenses four things must occur: (1) There must be an intent to defraud. (2) There must be an actual fraud committed. (3) False pretenses must be used for the purpose of perpetrating the fraud. (4) The fraud must be accomplished by means of false pretenses made use of for the purpose; that is, they must be in some degree the cause, if not the con trolling and decisive cause, which induced the owner to part with his property. Anable v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 563, 1873 Va. LEXIS 14 (1873); Hubbard v. Commonwealth, 201 Va. 61, 109 S.E.2d 100, 1959 Va. LEXIS 193 (1959); Bourgeois v. Commonw ealth, 217 Va. 268, 227 S.E.2d 714, 1976 Va. LEXIS 270 (1976); Riegert v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 511, 237 S.E.2d 803, 1977 Va. LEXIS 282 (1977); Sult v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 915, 275 S.E.2d 608, 1981 Va. LEXIS 228 (1981); Quidley v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 963, 275 S.E.2d 622, 1981 Va. LEXIS 234 (1981); Millard v. Commonwealth, 34 Va. App. 202, 539 S.E.2d 84, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 850 (2000). Under the provisions of this section, for one to be guilty of the crime of larceny by false pretense, he must make a false representation of an existing fact with knowledge of its falsity and, on that basis, obtain from another person money or other property which may be the subject of larceny, with the intent to defraud. Lund v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 688, 232 S.E.2d 745, 1977 Va. LEXIS 224 (1977). Merely showing that the accused knowingly stated what was false is not sufficient; there must also be proof that his intent was to defraud. Riegert v. Commonwealt h, 218 Va. 511, 237 S.E.2d 803, 1977 Va. LEXIS 282 (1977). An essential element of larceny by false pretenses is that both title to and possession of property must pass from the victim to the defendant (or his nominee). T he gravamen of the offense is the obtainment of ownership of property. Baker v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 192, 300 S.E.2d 788, 1983 Va. LEXIS 208 (1983); Davies v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 350, 423 S.E.2d 839, 9 Va. Law Rep. 586, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 285 (19 92). The victim need only rely to some degree on the false pretense in order for the Commonwealth to satisfy the fourth prong of this test. Bestwick v. Commonwealth, 2 000 Va. App. LEXIS 222 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2000). Grand larceny by false pretenses conviction was reversed, and the case was dismissed, where the state failed to present evidence that defendant acquired any type of ownership interest in the vehicle he allegedly stole, such as a promissory note, sales contract, or other document that would have evidenced some type of ownership transfer. Shropshire v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 34, 577 S.E.2d 521, 2003 Va. App. LEX IS 122 (2003). Motion by a volunteer fire department and its president was denied because the treasurer, who could only be terminated for good cause, had an established property interest in his continued employment, sufficiently alleged an ultra vires action, sufficiently alleged that the president made a defamatory statement even if the statement was initially subject to a qualified privilege, and the complaint supported a req uest for punitive damages. Charles v. Front Royal Volunteer Fire &amp; Rescue Dep't, Inc., 21 F. Supp. 3d 620, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65366 (W.D. Va. 2014), dismissed, No. 5:13cv00120, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175440 (W.D. Va. Dec. 19, 2014). Commonwealth of Virginia failed to prove that defendant took property belonging to another because defendant acted on behalf of a company which defendant owned th at owned and operated a cemetery when defendant requested that funds be disbursed from the companys preneed trust account and be deposited into the companys operating account. Thus, the legal ownership of the funds remained unchanged as the compa ny was the legal owner of the funds. Crouch v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 209 (Va. Ct. App. May 27, 2014). Gravamen is that pretenses are false.  The gravamen of the offense is that the pretenses are false, and if the prisoner can show that the representations upon which he obtained the property from the ow ner are true, he cannot be convicted. Anable v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 563, 1873 Va. LEXIS 14 (1873). The gravamen of the offense is the obtainment of ownership of property, by false representations or pretenses. Quidley v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 963, 275 S.E.2d 62 2, 1981 Va. LEXIS 234 (1981).

United States v. Guyette, 382 F. Supp. 1266, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6697 (E.D. Va. 1974). The enactment of former § 18.2-187 (see now § 18.2-187.1), which forbids obtaining phone services with an invalid credit card, is evidence that the General Assembly did not believe this section adequate to protect the phone company from verbal fraud. United States v. Guyette, 382 F. Supp. 1266, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6697 (E.D. Va. 1974). This section forbids only physical or mechanical means, methods, and devices of defrauding those who own and operate pay telephones and other coin-operated machines, and not verbal fraud practiced upon a phone company by the artifice of giving the telephone operators false, invalid, or nonexistent credit card num ber. United States v. Guyette, 382 F. Supp. 1266, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6697 (E.D. Va. 1974). Only o wners of coin telephones can be verbally defrauded.  While the owners of all machines in the coin-in-the-slot category may be mechanically defrauded, only the owners of coin telephones can be verbally  defrauded.

CASE NOTES Object of section.  This section is specifically aimed at discouraging the giving of a bad check for a cash purchase when the drawer has, instead of the present means, only a vague i ntention to make the check good at some time in the future. Cook v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 251, 16 S.E.2d 635, 1941 Va. LEXIS 160 (1941); Rosser v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 813, 66 S.E.2d 851, 1951 Va. LEXIS 229 (1951); Bagheri v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 1 071, 408 S.E.2d 259, 8 Va. Law Rep. 440, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 275 (1991). Burden of proof.  By issuing the check, the appellant impliedly represented that the account contained funds sufficient to honor the check; therefore, the burden of producing evide nce that he expressly represented otherwise was with the appellant. Bolinsky v. Commonwealth, No. 2055-93-2 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 14, 1995). Depository.  The depository language in this section refers to the institution upon which the funds are drawn, not the entity where the check is uttered. Warner v. Com monwealth, 30 Va. App. 141, 515 S.E.2d 803, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 395 (1999). Or.  The language make or draw or utter or deliver is in the disjunctive and there is nothing in the section to indicate that or should be read to mean and. Thus, or is to be given its ordinary meaning. Patterson v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 306, 218 S.E.2d 435, 1975 Va. LEXIS 286 (1975). This section encompasses a worthless check given to obtain cash as well as the giving of bad checks for what purports to be a cash purchase. Warren v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 416, 247 S.E.2d 692, 1978 Va. LEXIS 198 (1978). Elements differ from common-law la rceny.  The elements of the offense under this section are materially different from those of common-law larceny. Payne v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 485, 281 S.E.2d 873, 1981 Va. LEXIS 332 (1981). Essential element.  False representation that a check is good is a necessary element of the offense at which the statute is directed. Hubbard v. Commonwealth, 201 Va. 61, 109 S.E.2d 100, 1959 Va. LEXIS 193 (1959). An essential element of the bad check offense is that the drawer or utterer falsely represent that the check is good. Bolinsky v. Commonwealth, No. 2055-93-2 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 14, 1995). The gravamen of the offense is the fraudulent intent, and the lack of funds creates a pr ima facie but not a conclusive presumption of such intent. Turner v. Brenner, 138 Va. 232, 121 S.E. 510, 1924 Va. LEXIS 25 (1924); Rosser v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 813, 66 S.E.2d 851, 1951 Va. LEXIS 229 (1951). The gravamen of the offense denounced by this section is the intent to defraud. It is an indispensable element of the crime. Cook v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 251, 16 S.E.2d 635, 1941 Va. LEXIS 160 (1941). The gravamen of the offense created by this statute is the intent to defraud. Huntt v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 737, 187 S.E.2d 183, 1972 Va. LEXIS 249 (1972). Under the bad check statute, the gravamen of the offense is the intent to defraud. It may be established by either direct or circumstantial evidence. Sylvestre v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 253, 391 S.E.2d 336, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2281, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 68 (1990). Intent to defraud is an indispensable element of the crime and the burden is upon the Commonwealth to prove its existence at the time of drawing or uttering the c heck. Huntt v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 737, 187 S.E.2d 183, 1972 Va. LEXIS 249 (1972). Fraudulent intent in the mind of the drawer at the time the checks were written and negotiated is the gravamen of the offense, and an indispensable element of the crime. Absent the statutory presumption it must be proved by the Commonwealth. Rinkov v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 307, 191 S.E.2d 731, 1972 Va. LEXIS 351 (1972). Under this section, the gravamen of the offense is the intent to defraud. Such intent is an essential element of the crime, and the burden is on the Commonwealth to prove that it existed at the time the checks were drawn or uttered. Patterson v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 306, 218 S.E.2d 435, 1975 Va. LEXIS 286 (1975). Under this section, the gravamen of the offense is the intent to defraud, and the offense is complete when, with the requisite intent, a person utters a check he knows to be worthless. Warren v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 416, 247 S.E.2d 692, 1978 Va. LEXIS 198 (1978). And the crime is committed when the drawer utters the check. Cook v. Commonwealth, 178 Va . 251, 16 S.E.2d 635, 1941 Va. LEXIS 160 (1941); Rosser v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 813, 66 S.E.2d 851, 1951 Va. LEXIS 229 (1951). Thus, payment is no bar to prosecution .  A prosecution might be carried on even if the drawer had made payment within the period specified in § 18.2-183. Such payment would constitute no bar to prosec ution; it would merely negative the presumption of fraudulent intent which would otherwise obtain. Cook v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 251, 16 S.E.2d 635, 1941 Va. LEXIS 160 (1941). An d drawers subsequent acts are relevant only as to intent.  The acts of the drawer in his dealings with the holder after issuing the check are relevant only insofar as they tend to prove or disprove the actual commission o f the crime on the date upon which the check was drawn. Cook v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 251, 16 S.E.2d 635, 1941 Va. LEXIS 160 (1941). Since the crime, if any, is committed at the time the check is drawn, subsequent acts of the drawer are of evidential value only in helping to establish the opera tive fact of fraudulent intent. Cook v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 251, 16 S.E.2d 635, 1941 Va. LEXIS 160 (1941). The intent to defraud under this section for making or passing a bad check must be based upon a false representation that the check as written and delivered is good. Thus, the bad check offense as defined by the statute has not been committed if the payee knows at the time that the check was made and delivered that it was not then good or c ollectible. Bolinsky v. Commonwealth, No. 2055-93-2 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 14, 1995). Express representation not necessary .  This section, in terms, dispenses with the proof of express representation. Hubbard v. Commonwealth, 201 Va. 61, 109 S.E.2d 100, 1959 Va. LEXIS 193 (1959) . This section dispenses with proof of an extrinsic representation that check was good. Warren v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 416, 247 S.E.2d 692, 1978 Va. LEXIS 198 (197 8). And it need not be shown that the implied representation was relied upon, etc. And it need not be shown that the implied representation was relied upon or that anythin g was received in return for the check. Warren v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 416, 247 S.E.2d 692, 1978 Va. LEXIS 198 (1978). To prove a bad-check offense, it need not be shown that anything was received in return for the check, for the offense is complete when, with the requisite intent , a person utters a check he knows to be worthless.

CASE NOTES This section defines a mere rule of evidence upon which the Commonwealth may rely in fac ilitating proof of the fraudulent intent of the drawer. Cook v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 251, 16 S.E.2d 635, 1941 Va. LEXIS 160 (1941); Rinkov v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 307, 191 S.E.2d 731, 1972 Va. LEXIS 351 (1972); Alley v. Paderick, 373 F. Supp. 920, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12222 (W.D. Va. 1974); Patterson v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 306, 218 S.E.2d 435, 1975 Va. LEXIS 286 (1975); Bray v. Commonwealth, 9 Va. App. 417, 388 S.E.2d 837, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1335, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 23 (1990). And need not be charged in indictment.  Accused assigned as error the failure of the indictment to contain an allegation as to the five days notice, mentioned in this section. It was held that this section, dealing only with a rule of evidence, is not an element of the crime and need not be charged in the indictment. Cook v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 251, 16 S.E.2d 635, 1941 Va. LEXIS 160 (1941). And the Commonwealth may prosecute even though no notice of dishonor was ever given, but in such event the Commonwealth would be required to prove affirmatively the existence of a fraudulent intent in the mind of the drawer. Cook v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 251, 16 S.E.2d 635, 1941 Va. LEXIS 160 (1941); Alley v. Paderick, 373 F. Supp. 920, 197 4 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12222 (W.D. Va. 1974). Where petitioner was not notified pursuant to the provisions of this section, it was inapplicable to his case, and consequently, the Commonwealth could not avail itself of the statutory presumption and had to affirmatively establish petitioners fraudulent intent. Alley v. Paderick, 373 F. Supp. 920, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12222 (W.D. Va. 1974). The presumption is rebuttable.  Under this section, if the holder gives written notice of dishonor to the drawer, and payment is not made within five days therefrom, a presumption arises that th e drawer uttered the check with fraudulent intent, but this presumption may be rebutted. Cook v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 251, 16 S.E.2d 635, 1941 Va. LEXIS 160 (1941). This section creates a rebuttable presumption of the necessary intent and knowledge if a dishonored check is not paid within five days after giving of the notice specified in the statute. Huntt v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 737, 187 S.E.2d 183, 1972 Va. LEXIS 249 (1972). In finding defendant guilty of presenting bad checks, the trial court properly relied on the statutory rebuttable presumption from which it could find, but was no t required to find, that defendant had the intent to defraud when he presented the worthless checks for payment to the store owner and properly imposed on the Commonwealth the ultimate burden of persuasion. Cox v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 273 (V a. Ct. App. Aug. 23, 2011). And does not arise where payee given notice of lack of funds.  Where one gives a check without funds in the bank to cover it, but informs the payee of such conditions, even if he had fraudulent intent in such transaction, it is not within the terms of this section, and there should be no prima facie presumption of an attempt to defraud. Turner v. Brenner, 138 Va. 232, 121 S.E. 510, 1924 Va. LEXIS 25 (1924). Proof of either actual receipt of notice or date payee sent notice not required.  The statute does not require the Commonwealth to establish either actual receipt of the notice or the date the payee sent the notice; rather, the statute only req uires proof that the notice was sent by certified mail and that the accused failed to repay the amount due within five days. Motsinger v. Commonwealth, No. 1406-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 13, 1999). Presumption appl ies where bank account was closed.  When defendant drew checks on banks at which his accounts had been closed, the statutory presumption of fraudulent intent in § 18.2-183 applied to him, even th ough the statute only spoke of such a presumption existing when a check was drawn on a bank at which the drawer had no account. The fact that § 18.2-184 specifically mentioned closed accounts did not mean that the legislature, in failing to mention cl osed accounts in § 18.2-183, did not mean for the presumption in § 18.2-183 to apply when a check was drawn on a bank at which the drawers account was closed because when provisions in one act were omitted from another act on the same subject, the omitted provisions were applied where the purposes of the two acts were consistent. Sykes v. Commonwealth, 42 Va. App. 581, 593 S.E.2d 545, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 98 (2004). Language of § 18.2-200.1 plainly means that a request for a return of money advanced on a construction project is sufficient notice if sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, without proof of actual receipt, unlike the notices required by the bad check law, former § 6.1-117, now codified at § 18.2-183, Virginia Tort Claims Act, § 8.01-195.1 et seq., the Virginia Habitual Offenders Act, forme r § 46.2-355, repealed in 1999, and the Virginia Interstate Agreement on Detainers, art. III(b), found in § 53.1-210. Holsapple v. Commonwealth, 266 Va. 593, 587 S.E.2d 561, 2003 Va. LEXIS 96 (2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 826, 125 S. Ct. 164, 160 L. Ed. 2d 39, 2004 U.S. LEXIS 5746 (2004). Evidence sufficient to invok e presumption.  Where the Commonwealth introduced two returned checks stamped insufficient funds as well as bank statements indicating that the checks were both presented and returned on two separate occasions, and it was shown that the payee notified defendant by certified mail that the bank dishonored the checks and that the payee had demanded payment within five days but received none, the evidence was sufficient to i nvoke the rebuttable presumption of this section. Bagheri v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 1071, 408 S.E.2d 259, 8 Va. Law Rep. 440, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 275 (1991). Where the defendant admitted that she wrote a check upon a bank, and the evidence showed that the check was returned with the stamp account closed, the ev idence was sufficient to invoke the presumption created by statute that the check was issued with intent to defraud. Bratton v. Commonwealth, No. 1003-97-3 (Ct. of Appeals June 9, 1998). Where the defendant failed to pay the amount of a check within five days after being notified that the check was not paid by the bank, the evidence was sufficient to invoke the presumption created by this section that she knew she had insufficient funds in her account when she wrote the check. Bratton v. Commonwealth, No. 1003-97-3 (Ct. of Appeals June 9, 1998). In defendants prosecution for uttering bad checks, the Commonwealth was entitled to the rebuttable presumption under § 18.2-183, to the effect that the ret urn of a check by a drawee bank because of lack of funds constituted prima facie evidence of intent to defraud unless the maker paid the holder the amount due within five days of receiving written notice of dishonor, because defendant did not pay the amo unt due to the store within five days of the stores giving notice; thus, the Commonwealth presented prima facie evidence of defendants intent to defraud when she cashed the checks at the store. The trier of fact was entitled to discount defendant s explanations and conclude that she had failed to rebut the presumption. Charles v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 130 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 19, 2011). Defendants failure to overcome the rebuttable presumption.  Trial court could properly find from the evidence of defendants passing a check that was returned for insufficient funds and defendants bank statements sh owing that his account was overdrawn that defendant failed to rebut the presumption arising under § 18.2-183 that he wrote the check with the intent to defraud the hardware seller, knowing he did not have sufficient funds in his account to pay the che ck. Hartman v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 70 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 10, 2004). Eviden ce did not raise presumption of fraudulent intent.  Evidence showing that defendant had received actual notice by telephone that her check had been returned for insuffici...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-184"><akn:num>§ 18.2-184</akn:num><akn:heading>Presumption as to notation attached to check, draft or order</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text In any prosecution or action under the preceding sections, any notation attached to or stamped upon a check, draft or order which is refused by the drawee because of la ck of funds or credit, bearing the terms not sufficient funds, uncollected funds, account closed, or no account in this name, or words of similar import, shall be prima facie evidence that such notation is true and correct .

CASE NOTES Evidence sufficient to invok e presumption.  Where the defendant admitted that she wrote a check upon a bank, and the evidence showed that the check was returned with the stamp account closed, the ev idence was sufficient to invoke the presumption created by this section. Bratton v. Commonwealth, No. 1003-97-3 (Ct. of Appeals June 9, 1998). When defendant drew checks on banks at which his accounts had been closed, the statutory presumption of fraudulent intent in § 18.2-183 applied to him, even th ough the statute only spoke of such a presumption existing when a check was drawn on a bank at which the drawer had no account. The fact that § 18.2-184 specifically mentioned closed accounts did not mean that the legislature, in failing to mention cl osed accounts in § 18.2-183, did not mean for the presumption to apply when a check was drawn on a bank at which the drawers account was closed because when provisions in one act were omitted from another act on the same subject, the omitted provi sions were applied where the purposes of the two acts were consistent.

Mueller v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 649, 426 S.E.2d 339, 9 Va. Law Rep. 829, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 21 (1993). Evidence sufficient.  Appellant applied for credit with a car dealership and supplied information supplied which was entirely fraudulent, consisting of false addresses, false telephone numbers, a non-existent insurance policy and a falsified identification card, and appellant signed a temporary registration certificate and took possession of the car, driving it off the lot. She failed to pay for the sale of the car or the extension o f credit despite having acquired possession and title to the car. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence of a failure to pay to sustain appellants conviction under this section. Marsh v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 669, 530 S.E.2d 425, 2000 Va. App .

App. 7 21, 492 S.E.2d 480, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 668 (1997). Aggregation of value allowed.  Although none of the individual calls appellant made were shown to have a value in excess of $200, aggregation of the value of individual calls made in violation of this section was permitted to prove that the unlawful conduct was a felony. The unlawful calls for which appellant was indicted all occurred within approximately one hour of one another and were in execution of a general fraudulent scheme. JHA v. Comm onwealth, 18 Va. App. 349, 444 S.E.2d 258, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1355, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 307 (1994). Value of s ervices, not loss to phone company, controls.  Although appellant argued that the indictment alleged that the loss of the value of the calls, $300.85, was incurred by phone company, and therefore, because the evidence disclosed that phone companys loss was only a portion of the $300.85, appellant asserted that it had not been shown that phone company sustained a loss sufficient to prove the felony, the value of the service fraudulently obtained was proved to be $300.85, and the terms of its disposition by phone company, if collected, did not reduce the value of the service so obtained. JHA v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 349, 444 S.E.2d 258, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1355, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 307 (1994). Costs.  Under this section, the offense created is a species of larceny. As such, the value of service, credit or benefit procured is to be measured at the time the servi ces were taken. Penley v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 166, 655 S.E.2d 746, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 31 (2008). This section makes a distinction between value of services received and costs, and the latter are only recoverable as restitution. Penley v. Commo nwealth, 51 Va. App. 166, 655 S.E.2d 746, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 31 (2008). When defendant violated § 18.2-187.1 by using an illegal electrical meter, the value of the services he took was limited to the electrical current he used and did not include the costs incurred by the power company as a result of the theft. Thus, the trial court erred in considering the costs in determining that he obtained services worth more than $200; as the elements of a misdemeanor violation of § 18.2- 187.1, a lesser included offense, had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, defendant was to be resentenced. Penley v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 166, 655 S.E.2d 746, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 31 (2008). Notice of termination.  Evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant received the required written notice that defendants utility service was to be disconnected, as required b y subsection A of § 18.2-187.1, because the electric company mailed four termination notices to defendant pursuant to subsection C of § 18.2-187.1, and registered and certified mail was not a requirement, but merely created a rebuttable presumption . Lamb v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 40 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 5, 2013). Evidence of past behavior and usage.  Defendants conviction for felony obtaining or attempting to obtain utility service by fraud was proper because, based upon the evidence of his behavior and pa st usage of the utility, the jury reasonably inferred that he had diverted the gas to his residence in order to continue to use the gas as he had done in the past. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 113 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 5, 2011). Lack of standing.  Affiliate dealer was not an aggrieved party and therefore lacked standing to bring an anti-piracy claim against a telecommunications provider for failing to pay subscription fees owed to a satellite television system operator; it was the operators service that was allegedly pirated, not the dealers service. Sky Cable, LLC v. Coley, No. 5:11cv00048, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97129 (W.D. Va. July 11, 20 13). Statute of limitations.  Statute of limitations applicable to a satellite television system operators federal claim against a cable television provider and its owner for unauthorized distribution of programming was the two-year limitations period borrowed from Virginias anti-piracy statute, which is parallel in form and substance to 47 U.S.C.S. § 605. Sky Cable, LLC v. Coley, No. 5:11cv00048, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97129 (W.D. Va. July 11, 2013). Evidence sufficient.  Evidence supported defendants conviction of fraudulently obtaining electric service, as the circumstantial evidence established that defendant intentionally o btained electric service by altering an electric meter, allowing defendant to obtain free electricity after defendants service was disconnected.

Defendant made two payments for the room at the new rate, but she stopped paying for her room after July 4, 2017, and nevertheless remained there f or an additional 22 days without paying anything for the room over that period of time or thereafter.

App. LEXIS 294 (2020). Obtaining food.  To obtain food as used in subdivision 2 unambiguously refers to when the food is possessed with the intent to eat it, and the statutes equally plain l anguage requires the intent to cheat or defraud the owner or keeper to obtain food from a restaurant or other eating house; thus, subdivision 2 required proof that defendant had the intent to cheat or defraud the hotel restaurant at the time she gained p ossession of the food. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 298 Va. 517, 840 S.E.2d 343, 2020 Va. LEXIS 36 (2020). Defendant obtained food, as that phrase was used in the statute, at the time she gained possession of a breakfast with the intent to eat it because defend ant did not pay for the breakfast that she consumed at a hotel. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 298 Va. 517, 840 S.E.2d 343, 2020 Va. LEXIS 36 (2020). Express agreement for credit.  Where an inn accepted the defendants promissory note in satisfaction of the charges arising from accommodations procured by defendant, inarguably an express a greement for credit, the inn could not rely upon subsection 4 of § 18.2-188 when defendant subsequently defaulted. Louis v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 228, 578 S.E.2d 820, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 179 (2003). Unlawful to fraudulently procure entertainment from restaurant.  Crime of defrauding restaurant was complete when defendant accepted benefits of bands entertainment, while concealing fact that he had stopped payment on chec k written to cover cost of band. Morton v. Commonwealth, No. 0864-98-4 (Ct. of Appeals July 20, 1999). Trial cour t will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong.  Circuit courts finding of guilt and the judgment affirming that conviction, were contrary to the law and evidence and, therefore, plainly wrong because no rat ional trier of fact could have found the essential elements of defrauding a hotel restaurant beyond a reasonable doubt; the circuit court had reasonable doubt as to defendants intent to defraud at the time she gained possession of the food because it found that maybe she did not understand that she could not just be invited by a guest. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 298 Va. 517, 840 S.E.2d 343, 2020 Va. LEXIS 36 (2020). § 18.2-188.1. Defrauding person having a lien on an animal; penalty.

CASE NOTES Towing services.  While this section does not mention either the term tow truck or the word services, it is common knowledge that tow-truck services are necessary i n many highway accidents and that often a damaged vehicle must be towed to a garage before it can be stored, supplied with parts, altered, or repaired. Hence, in many cases, towing services are essential to the practical operation of this section. It is fairly arguable that such services are implicitly included in the statutes provisions.

For the purpose of this article, credit card shall als o include a similar device, whether known as a debit card, or any other name, issued with or without fee by an issuer for the use of the cardholder in obtaining money, goods, services or anything else of value by charging the account of the cardholder wi th a bank or any other person even though no credit is thereby extended. Expired credit card means a credit card which is no longer valid because the term show n on it has elapsed. Issuer means the business organization or financial institution or its duly authorized agent which issues a credit card. Payment device number means any code, account number or other means of account access, other than a check, draft or similar paper instrument, that can be used to obtain money, goods, services or anything else of value, or to initiate a transfer of funds. Payment device number does not include an encoded or truncated credit card nu mber or payment device number. Receives or receiving means acquiring possession or control of the credit card number or payment device number or accepting the same as security for a loan. Revoked credit card means a credit card which is no longer valid because permission to use it has been suspended or terminated by the issuer. Sales draft means a paper or electronic form evidencing a purchase of goods, services or anything else of value from a merchant through the use of a credit card. Cash advance/withdrawal draft means a paper form evidencing a cash advance or withdraw al from a bank or other financial institution through the use of a credit card.

CASE NOTES Jurisdiction.  All circuit courts in the Commonwealth possess subject matter jurisdiction over all felony prosecutions, including those for credit card theft; the circuit court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the four counts of credit card theft against defendant and possessed the statutory authority to impose punishment for those crimes. Bryant v. Commonwealth, 70 Va. App. 697, 832 S.E.2d 48, 2019 Va. App . LEXIS 200 (2019). There is no language in this section specifically creating prima facie evidence of credit card theft, although there is a provision that when a person, other than the cardholder or a person authorized by him, possesses two or more signed credit cards, such possession shall be prima facie evidence of credit card forgery. Cheatham v. Commonwe alth, 215 Va. 286, 208 S.E.2d 760, 1974 Va. LEXIS 275 (1974), overruled in part, Meeks v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 798, 651 S.E.2d 637, 2007 Va. LEXIS 127 (2007). If the General Assembly had intended to create prima facie evidence of withholding a credit card from mere possession of a recently stolen credit card, it would h ave included specific language to accomplish that purpose. Cheatham v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 286, 208 S.E.2d 760, 1974 Va. LEXIS 275 (1974), overruled in part, Meeks v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 798, 651 S.E.2d 637, 2007 Va. LEXIS 127 (2007). The word withhold must import something more than mere retention, for mere reten tion could be consistent with innocent intent. Cheatham v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 286, 208 S.E.2d 760, 1974 Va. LEXIS 275 (1974), overruled in part, Meeks v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 798, 651 S.E.2d 637, 2007 Va. LEXIS 127 (2007). The gravamen of this section is the taking of a single credit card, and the taking of ea ch card constitutes a separate statutory offense for which the perpetrator may be separately convicted and punished. Johnson v. Commonwealth, No. 1665-88-1 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 4, 1990). And each card take n represents a separate offense.  Trial court properly refused to merge three indictments for larceny under the single larceny doctrine, since the taking of credit cards represented separate statu tory offenses for each card defendant took. Scott v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. App. 276, 549 S.E.2d 624, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 449 (2001). The retention must be accompanied by an intent to deprive the owner of possession and to use the card, or to sell it, or to transfer it to a person other than the issuer or the cardholder. Cheatham v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 286, 208 S.E.2d 760, 1974 Va. LEXIS 275 (1974), overruled in part, Meeks v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 798, 651 S.E.2d 637, 2007 Va. LEXIS 127 (2007). The statute may be violated by proof that the accused was in receipt of the card knowing that it was taken from the possession, custody or control of the cardhold er without her consent. In a prosecution under those circumstances, the Commonwealth does not have to prove that the accused was the thief; however, it does have to prove that he had knowing receipt of a card with intent to use, sell or transfer it. Lyne v. Commonwealth, No. 2428-94-2 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 26, 1996). The taking must be with the intent to use, sell, or transfer the card to a person other than the issuer or the cardholder. Darnell v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 948, 408 S.E.2d 540, 8 Va. Law Rep. 318, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 185 (1991). Misuse of properly issued card not theft.  Defendants misuse of university motor pool gasoline card issued to him by the university to put gas into his own vehicle did not constitute credit card theft for purposes of this section. Sykes v. Commonwealth, 27 Va. App. 77, 497 S.E.2d 511, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 179 (1998). Presumption should not be extended.  The presumption of guilt from unexplained or falsely explained possession of recently stolen goods should not be extended to the withholding of a credit c ard, thus constituting statutory grand larceny. Cheatham v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 286, 208 S.E.2d 760, 1974 Va. LEXIS 275 (1974), overruled in part, Meeks v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 798, 651 S.E.2d 637, 2007 Va. LEXIS 127 (2007). A charge of mere possession of a stolen credit card is not sufficient to state the offen se of credit card theft under subdivision (1) (a). Wilder v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 145, 225 S.E.2d 411, 1976 Va. LEXIS 253 (1976) (decided under former § 18.1-125.3). Taking proved.  The statute does not require the Commonwealth to prove that defendant received the credit card number directly from the cardholder. Nor does the statute exclude i ndividuals who obtain credit card numbers from discarded receipts, via the telephone or the Internet, or any of the myriad ways in which credit card numbers can be fraudulently acquired without possession of the credit card or without the cardholders consent. Therefore, where defendant acquired cardholders credit card number without his consent, the taking element of this section was proved because defendant interfered with cardholders right to determine who shall have the right to use his c redit card number. Harrison v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 525, 529 S.E.2d 330, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 401 (2000). Mere proof of possession of a recently stolen credit card is insufficient to support a c onviction for credit card theft. Sandoval v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 133, 455 S.E.2d 730, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 331 (1995). Double jeopardy.  Although appellant accurately noted that he committed the respective crimes in a similar manner, this fact did not render the convictions improper; under the Bloc kburger test, offenses charged were examined in the abstract, without referring to the particular facts of the case under review. Viewed in the abstract, identity theft and credit card fraud were separate offenses punishable in a single criminal proceedi ng; accordingly, appellants convictions for identity theft and for credit card fraud were proper and did not violate double jeopardy protections. Gheorghiu v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. App. 645, 682 S.E.2d 50, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 424 (2009), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 280 Va. 678, 701 S.E.2d 407, 2010 Va. LEXIS 268 (2010). Sufficiency of indictment.  Defendants convictions for credit card theft in violation of § 18.2-192 were proper because she provided no case law or authority to support her contention that time was an element of the offense of credit card theft. As time was not an element of the offense, the Commonwealth was not required to prove the exact date of the offenses, as long as the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the cr imes occurred and defendant committed the crimes; there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant obtained the credit cards and received the credit cards and, therefore, the trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to prove the off enses. Trang Chau v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 1, 2011). Venue.  Credit card theft, § 18.2-192, and credit card fraud, § 18.2-195, were different offenses; venue for prosecution of credit card theft was not established in the Circuit Court of the City of Alexandria because the crime was completed where the card was taken, which was outside of the city, regardless of the fact that defendant later used the credit card in Alexandria. Meeks v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 798, 651 S.E.2d 637, 2007 Va. LEXIS 127 (2007). Venue in Alexandria, Virginia, was established in defendants trial for credit card theft and credit card fraud because defendants fraudulent use of the st olen credit card at a hotel in Alexandria established an element of the crime, and raised a strong presumption that an act in furtherance of the crime occurred in Alexandria. Meeks v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 604 (Va. Ct. App. May 10, 2006), rev 'd, dismissed, 274 Va. 798, 651 S.E.2d 637, 2007 Va. LEXIS 127 (2007). Venue, under § 18.2-198.1, was proper in Alexandria, Virginia because defendant committed credit card theft, in violation of subdivision (1)(a) of § 18.2-19 2, by unlawfully taking a credit card from its rightful owner, defendants former employer in Alexandria, with the intent to use the card when defendant was terminated, thereby completing the crime of credit card theft in Alexandria, ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-193"><akn:num>§ 18.2-193</akn:num><akn:heading>Credit card forgery</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) A person i s guilty of credit card forgery when: (a) With intent to defraud a purported issuer, a person or organization providing money, goods, services or anything else of value, or any other person, he falsely makes or falsely embosses a purported credit card or utters such a credit card; or (b) He, not being the cardholder or a person authorized by him, with intent to defraud the issuer, or a person or organization providing money, goods, services or anything else of value , or any other person, signs a credit card; or (c) He, not being the cardholder or a person authorized by him, with intent to defraud the issuer, or a person or organization providing money, goods, services or anything else of value , or any other person, forges a sales draft or cash advance/withdrawal draft, or uses a credit card number of a card of which he is not the cardholder, or utters, or attempts to employ as true, such forged draft knowing it to be forged. (2) A person f alsely makes a credit card when he makes or draws, in whole or in part, a device or instrument which purports to be the credit card of a named issuer but which is not such a credit card because the issuer did not authorize the making or drawing, or alter s a credit card which was validly issued. (3) A person f alsely embosses a credit card when, without the authorization of the named issuer, he completes a credit card by adding any of the matter, other than the signature of the cardholder, which an issuer requires to appear on the credit card before it can be used by a cardholder.

Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, § 94. CASE NOTES Testimony did no t implicate ultimate issue of fact.  None of the elements of this section were testified to by witness. Witness simply testified that the person in the videotape appeared to be the defendant. He did not testify that defendant used the victims credit card, had the intent to defraud, or to any other element of the offense. Accordingly, witnesss testimony did not implicate an ultimate issue of fact and the trial court did not err by allowing hi s testimony. Rogers v. Commonwealth, No. 2269-96-1 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 7, 1997). Handwriting expert testimo ny not necessary.  It was not necessary that a handwriting expert testify concerning the writing on the Food Lion receipt in order for the jury to conclude defendant forged the docu ment. From the evidence of the Food Lion tape showing the actual transaction made with the victims stolen credit card, the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant, with the intent to defraud the victim, forged a sales draft or us ed the victims credit card number, or uttered as true the forged draft, knowing it to be forged, in violation of subdivision (1)(c). Sabur v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 456 (Va. Ct. App. June 20, 2000). Fatal variance.  In a prosecution of defendant for credit card forgery, a fatal variance existed between the indictment and the conduct for which the trial court convicted defenda nt. The trial court erred in ruling that the Commonwealth proved defendant guilty of credit card forgery, as there was no evidence that defendant either made or embossed a credit card, and the indictment failed to charge defendant with uttering. Arrate v . Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 32 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 12, 2019). Evidence held sufficient.  When defendant used a credit card account access number that had been issued with another persons data, supplied by defendant who was representing himself as that person, he employed a device issued to someone else; it was not necessary for that person to be aware that an application for credit had been made in his name. Hill v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 256 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 30, 2002). Sufficient evidence showed defendant was the perpetrator of credit card theft, under § 18.2-192, and credit card forgery, under § 18.2-193, because the evid ence showed: (1) the victim gave defendant a credit card but never got it back; (2) unauthorized charges subsequently appeared on the victims bank statement; (3) a surveillance tape showed a young male with black, wide-framed glasses use the card; (4 ) a hat similar to one in the video was found in defendants residence, as was an item bought with the card at that time; and (5) defendants inconsistent statements while testifying allowed an inference that defendant lied to conceal guilt.

The 2005 amendment by c. 157 substituted § 18.2-192 for subdivision (1) (b) of § 18.2-193. CASE NOTES Prima facie evidence.  Circuit court properly, via a jury verdict, convicted defendant of credit card theft because the constitutionality of the statutory prima facie provision did not affect the jurys verdict since the jury instruction did not provide that the offense required a showing that defendant acted with specific intent to use, sell, or transfer them once he received them, and defendants challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence  that the owners credit cards were unlawfully obtained by him or that he had the intent to use them  failed to establish that the evidence was insufficient to support the offense under the alternative basis contained in the inst ruction received by the jury relating to receiving the stolen credit cards.

(2) A person w ho is authorized by an issuer to furnish money, goods, services or anything else of value upon presentation of a credit card or credit card number by the cardholder, or any agent or employee of such person, is guilty of a credit card fraud when, with int ent to defraud the issuer or the cardholder, he: (a) Furn ishes money, goods, services or anything else of value upon presentation of a credit card or credit card number obtained or retained in violation of § 18.2-192, or a credit card or credit card number which he knows is expired or revoked; (b) Fails to furnish money, goods, services or anything else of value which he represents or causes to be represented in writing or by any other means to the issuer that he has furnishe d; or (c) Remits to an issuer or acquirer a record of a credit card or credit card number transaction which is in excess of the monetary amount authorized by the cardholder.

(4) Any person who conspires, confederates or combines with another, (i) either within or without the Commonwealth to commit credit card fraud within the Commonwealth or (ii) within the Commonwealth to commit credit card fraud within or without the Commonwealth, is gu ilty of a Class 6 felony.

Rev. 227 (2010). CASE NOTES Not aggravated felony for purposes of immigration proceeding.  Virginias credit card fraud offense did not substantially correspond to a theft offense under 8 U.S.C.S. § 1101(a)(43)(G); additionally, the indictment did not show that the alien was convicted of all the elements of a theft offense under § 1101(a)(43)(G) because: (1) she was not charged with taking goods without the consent of the merchant; and (2) it was not conclusive from the indictment that she act ually obtained any property from the cardholder. Therefore, she was not convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of 8 U.S.C.S. § 1101(a)(43), and the order for her removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C.S. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) was vacated. Soliman v. Gonzales, 419 F.3d 276, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 17989 (4th Cir. 2005). Venue.  Credit card theft, § 18.2-192, and credit card fraud, § 18.2-195, were different offenses; venue for prosecution of credit card theft was not established in the Circuit Court of the City of Alexandria because the crime was completed where the card was taken, which was outside of the city, regardless of the fact that defendant later used the credit card in Alexandria. Meeks v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 798, 651 S.E.2d 637, 2007 Va. LEXIS 127 (2007). Venue in Alexandria, Virginia, was established in defendants trial for credit card theft and credit card fraud because defendants fraudulent use of the st olen credit card at a hotel in Alexandria established an element of the crime, and raised a strong presumption that an act in furtherance of the crime occurred in Alexandria. Meeks v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 604 (Va. Ct. App. May 10, 2006), rev 'd, dismissed, 274 Va. 798, 651 S.E.2d 637, 2007 Va. LEXIS 127 (2007). Defendants possession of the male victims credit card number was based on the fact that he had the number when he was arrested in Arlington County, and at that point, the credit card number had already been used to purchase a laptop computer in Fairfax and the crime of credit card fraud in violation of § 18.2-195 was complete. Therefore, possession of the credit card number in Arlington County subseque nt to the commission of the crime could not further the crime, and the Court of Appeals judgment sustaining the trial courts ruling that venue was proper in Arlington County under § 18.2-198.1 was erroneous and had to be set aside. Gheorghiu v . Commonwealth, 280 Va. 678, 701 S.E.2d 407, 2010 Va. LEXIS 268 (2010). Venue, under § 18.2-198.1, was proper in Alexandria, Virginia because defendant committed credit card theft, in violation of subdivision (1)(a) of § 18.2-19 2, by unlawfully taking a credit card from its rightful owner, defendants former employer in Alexandria, with the intent to use the card when defendant was terminated, thereby completing the crime of credit card theft in Alexandria, even though defen dant committed the crime of credit card fraud, in violation of § 18.2-195, by using the card to make personal purchases in Maryland. Baldwin v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 348 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 15, 2011). Business record exception.  Defendants convictions for credit card theft and credit card fraud were proper because the trial court did not err in admitting credit card statements under t he business record exception to the hearsay rule. A financial investigator testified that in the course of doing business, the company maintained records in relation to the charges and payments on credit cards and that those records were made contemporan eously with the actions taken with regard to the credit accounts; according to the investigator, the statements were an accurate account of the credit card companys records at the time they were printed prior to trial. Trang Chau v. Commonwealth, 201 1 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 1, 2011). Evidence did not support a conviction for attempted credit card fraud where, although th ere was evidence that the defendant knew that his unemployed companion had a credit card he was attempting to use to make substantial purchases, there was no evidence that the defendant knew that the credit card did not belong to his companion. Poindexte r v. Commonwealth, No. 0457-98-2 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 27, 1999). Evidence s upported a conviction for credit card fraud.  Where defendant told store clerk that the credit card number was his and then testified at trial that his girlfriend gave him the number, defendant would have no reason to tell clerk the credit card number was his if he had not known the status of the number. And where defendant gave clerk a false address when he filled out the warranty card for his purchase, this evidence was sufficient for the trial judge to fi nd beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had the requisite intent to defraud. Harrison v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 525, 529 S.E.2d 330, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 401 (2000). When defendant used a credit card account access number that had been issued with another persons data, supplied by defendant who was representing himself as that person, he employed a device issued to or for the benefit of someone else; it was not necessary for that person to be aware that an application for credit had been made in his name. Hill v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 256 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 30 , 2002). Defendants convictions for credit card fraud, under § 18.2-195, were affirmed because the evidence that defendant used ATM cards to make withdrawals from a bank account of his employers company without permission and purchased personal items with the cash obtained from the withdrawals was sufficient to support the convictions. Abbett v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 115 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 11, 2008) . Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for credit card fraud, although the cardholder, defendants employer, had twice previously given defendant perm ission to possess and use the card, because defendant did not have permission to possess the card when he made four other separate and discrete purchases. Kovalaske v. Commonwealth, 56 Va. App. 224, 692 S.E.2d 641, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 197 (2010).

History History. 2005, c. 166. Annotations CASE NOTES Sufficiency of the evidence.  Evidence supported defendants convictions because defendant, who worked for a car rental company, confessed in a written statement to police that defendant us ed a card scanning device to obtain the victims credit card numbers, defendants agent identification number appeared on the employers rental paperwork of all of the victims, defendant was present at the rental car transactions with many of th e victims, and the instances of fraud occurred within a few days of a victims rental transaction.

CASE NOTES Establishing ven ue for credit card theft and fraud.  Credit card theft, § 18.2-192, and credit card fraud, § 18.2-195, were different offenses; venue for prosecution of credit card theft was not established in the Circuit Court of the City of Alexandria because the crime was completed where the card was taken, which was outside the city, regardless of the fact that defendant later used the credit card in Alexandria. Meeks v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 798, 651 S.E .2d 637, 2007 Va. LEXIS 127 (2007). Based on the record, there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a strong presumption that any part of obtaining, accessing or recording the female victims identifying information with the intent to defraud occurred in Arlington County; there was no evidence showing where the laptop belonging to defendant was located when accessed, who accessed it, or who remagged the credit card numbers, specifically the female victims number, onto the credit cards. The lack of such evidence made it impossible to sustain a strong presumption that any part of the crime of identity theft under§ 18.2-186.3 occurred in Arlington County, and therefore, venue in that co unty was improper under § 18.2-198.1.Gheorghiu v. Commonwealth, 280 Va. 678, 701 S.E.2d 407, 2010 Va. LEXIS 268 (2010). Defendants convictions for credit card theft and credit card fraud were proper because the trial court did not err in finding that an act in furtherance of th e credit card fraud occurred in Loudoun County and holding that venue was appropriate in that jurisdiction. Defendant told a postal inspector that she obtained the credit cards, an investigator testified that the credit car was activated from defendant s Loudoun County home, and another investigator testified that the credit card statements were sent to defendants Loudoun County home. Trang Chau v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 1, 2011). Venue, under § 18.2-198.1, was proper in Alexandria, Virginia because defendant committed credit card theft, in violation of subdivision (1)(a) of § 18.2-19 2, by unlawfully taking a credit card from its rightful owner, defendants former employer in Alexandria, with the intent to use the card when defendant was terminated, thereby completing the crime of credit card theft in Alexandria, even though defen dant committed the crime of credit card fraud, in violation of § 18.2-195, by using the card to make personal purchases in Maryland. Baldwin v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 348 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 15, 2011). Circuit court did not err in concluding that venue was proper in that court to prosecute defendant for the credit card theft charge related to the unused credit c ard; defendant possessed four stolen credit cards and used three of them at an Arlington County store, he possessed all cards without the owners permission, and he lied repeatedly to the police about his identity and how he came to possess the cards, showing he possessed the unused card with the requisite intent to use it in Arlington County. Bryant v. Commonwealth, 70 Va. App. 697, 832 S.E.2d 48, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 200 (2019). Venue improper.  Defendants possession of the male victims credit card number was based on the fact that he had the number when he was arrested in Arlington County, and at that point, the credit card number had already been used to purchase a laptop computer in Fairfax and the crime of credit card fraud in violation of § 18.2-195 was complete.

False Pretenses and Cheats, § 3; 12A M.J. Larceny , § 2. CASE NOTES Elements of offense.  This section consists of the following five elements: (1) obtaining an advance of money from another person; (2) a fraudulent intent at the time the advance is ob tained; (3) a promise to perform construction or improvement involving real property; (4) a failure to perform the promise; and (5) a failure to return the advance within fifteen days of a request to do so by certified mail to the defendants last kno wn address or his address listed in the contract. Raymer v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 265 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2000); Baugh v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 589 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 23, 2001). Elements of offense.  When considering the requirement of the construction fraud statute to prove a victim demanded return of an advance, an unequivocal demand had to be proved because the textual simplicity of the statutes description of the required notice meant the notice could not include anything other than an unqualified demand. Bowman v. Commonwealth, 290 Va. 492, 777 S.E.2d 851, 2015 Va. LEXIS 139 (2015). Circuit court erred in convicting defendant of failure to perform a promise for construction in return for advances because the Commonwealth failed to prove prope r notice under the statute where, while the homeowner sent a demand letter by certified mail and defendant received it, defendant was convicted of a non-offense inasmuch as the demand was not sent return receipt requested, defendant did not have the burden to explain how a return receipt request would provide different notice than the method employed by the homeowner. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 134 (Va. Ct. App. May 23, 2017). Fraud depends on circumstances.  Whether fraud actually existed will depend upon the circumstances of each case. Norman v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 518, 346 S.E.2d 44, 3 Va. Law Rep. 74, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 301 (1986). And conduct and represen tations of defendant.  To determine whether or not there was fraudulent intent, the court will look to the conduct and representations of the defendant. Norman v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. Ap p. 518, 346 S.E.2d 44, 3 Va. Law Rep. 74, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 301 (1986). Fraudulent intent.  A defendants use of false statements is a significant factor that tends to prove fraudulent intent in construction fraud. Rader v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 3 25, 423 S.E.2d 207, 9 Va. Law Rep. 566, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (1992). Trial court did not err in admitting evidence that builder violated three building code provisions. Evidence of the violations was relevant and probative because it tended to show his state of mind in performing the contract and his intent to defraud. Rader v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 325, 423 S.E.2d 207, 9 Va. Law Rep. 566, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (1992). Construction fraud can occur despite the fact that a builder or contractor begins to perform on the contract. The relevant question is whether a builder or contra ctor, in accepting an advance based upon future work promised, had fraudulent intent not to perform or to perform only partially, not whether the contractor had performed work for which he was paid. Rader v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 325, 423 S.E.2d 207, 9 Va. Law Rep. 566, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (1992). The time for determining fraudulent intent is the time at which the defendant procures the advance, not at the time the parties enter into the contract. Rader v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 325, 423 S.E.2d 207, 9 Va. Law Rep. 566, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (1992). A trial judge could infer intent to defraud from the defendants failure to do anything in furtherance of his promise to perform after he received payment and also could consider as evidence tending to prove intent to defraud, as well as from the defendants pattern of conduct regarding the two victims, who were neighbors, and others. Raymer v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 265 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 20 00). When a defendant is alleged to have failed to perform construction in return for an advance of money, whether a fraudulent intent existed at the time the advance was obtained depends upon the circumstances of the case; the defendants conduct and representations must be examined in order to determine if a fraudulent intent existed at the time. A defendants use of false statements is a significant factor th at tends to prove fraudulent intent in construction fraud. Baugh v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 589 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 23, 2001). In a construction fraud case under § 18.2-200.1, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that defendant obtained an advance of funds with fraudulent intent where defendants false representation and his failure to timely complete the project were the sole factors indicative of a fraudulent intent. While defendants performance and progress were below expectations, the evidence showed that defe ndant was working, albeit leisurely, towards completing the contract. Davis v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 287 (Va. Ct. App. July 20, 2010). Payment due at specified stage i n project.  The fact that a payment is due at a specified stage in a project does not, without more, prove whether it is payment for work completed or an advance or draw for work to be done. Rader v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 325, 423 S.E.2d 207, 9 Va. Law Rep. 566, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (1992). Evidence probative of state of mind.  Investigators testimony that he discussed with defendant, before the alleged construction fraud at issue occurred, his failure to return advances to several o f his clients, was properly admitted as it was probative of defendants state of mind and his intent to defraud the victims in the instant case. Mughrabi v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 538, 567 S.E.2d 542, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 446 (2002). Evidence supported the jurys finding of fraudulent intent at the time contractor rec eived an additional $400 for construction improvements job. Contractors removal of equipment from the job site immediately after he obtained the $400, without performing any additional work, entitled the jury to infer that the intent not to do furthe r work existed when appellant took the money. Fenlason v. Commonwealth, No. 1492-91-2 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 12, 1993). Promise to do something in the future is not the equivalent of substantially making good such advance, even if the defendant had offered to repay the advance. Norman v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 518, 346 S.E.2d 44, 3 Va. Law Rep. 74, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 301 (1986). Construction fraud can occur despite the fact that a builder begins work on contract; th e relevant question is whether a builder or contractor obtained an advance based upon future work promised with a fraudulent intent not to perform or to perform only partially, not whether the contractor had performed work for which he was paid. Holsappl e v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 480, 566 S.E.2d 210, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 376 (2002), aff'd, 39 Va. App. 522, 574 S.E.2d 756, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (2003). A septic system falls within the scope of this section since it is a tangible object (a structure) permanently annexed to real property. Boothe v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 484, 358 S.E.2d 740, 4 Va. Law Rep. 147, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (1987). Proof of actual receipt of notice of demand to return payment was not needed. Holsapple v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 480, 566 S.E.2d 210, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 376 (2002), aff'd, 39 Va. App. 522, 574 S.E.2d 756, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (2003). Commonwealth did not have to prove that defendant received an actual notice from the victim requesting the return of funds that the victim advanced to defendant f or construction that was never performed as § 18.2-200.1 only required that the victim send a request for return of the funds advanced via certified mail with a return receipt requested, and the evidence showed that the victim followed that requiremen t. Holsapple v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 522, 574 S.E.2d 756, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 76, aff'd, 266 Va. 593, 587 S.E.2d 561, 2003 Va. LEXIS 96 (2003).

LEXIS 203 (1979). Section applicab le to non-oral advertisement only.  In enacting this section, the legislature was addressing itself solely to non-oral advertisement. Henry v. R.K. Chevrolet, Inc., 219 Va. 1011, 254 S.E.2d 66, 1979 Va. LEXIS 203 (1979). The amendment to this section, adding the language or uses any other method, device or practice which is fraudulent, deceptive or misleading to induce the pub lic to enter into any obligation, was not intended to expand the statute to cover verbal practices. Henry v. R.K. Chevrolet, Inc., 219 Va. 1011, 254 S.E.2d 66, 1979 Va. LEXIS 203 (1979). Resulting damages.  District court erred in granting summary judgment to plaintiff on a false advertising claim because, while a marketing brochure satisfied the statutory requiremen ts of a false advertisement, under § 18.2-216, because the brochure was an advertisement and it was, at a minimum, misleading or deceptive, the district court did not consider whether the brochure made plaintiff suffer loss. Persaud Cos. v. IBCS Group , Inc., 425 Fed. Appx. 223, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 8497 (4th Cir. 2011). Liability.  Where plaintiff asserted that two attorneys committed malpractice in the underlying case by failing to argue that no legally cognizable claim existed against him individually, since he was at all times acting as an employee or agent of the corporate defendant and the attorneys filed Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, underlying case was filed pursuant to §§ 18.2-216 and 59.1-68.3, and § 18.2-216 imposed individual liability. Golia v. Buoncristiani, No. 3:15CV00008, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149860 (W.D. Va. Nov. 4, 2015), dismissed in part, No. 3:15CV00008, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77072 (W.D. Va. June 14, 2016). Time limitations.  A cause of action for false advertising brought pursuant to § 59.1-68.3 and this section is subject to the limitation period prescribed in § 8.01-243 rather than the limitation period and accrual date for fraud set forth in §§ 8.01-243 (a) and 8.01-249 (1), respectively. McMillion v. Dryvit Sys., 262 Va. 463, 552 S.E.2d 364, 2001 Va. LEXIS 110 (2001). Buyer of sellers assets and trademark was precluded from claiming false advertising by the sellers under § 18.2-216 based on the sellers use of the tra demark in violation of the sale agreement, since the two-year limitations period for asserting the claims after the sellers began using the trademark expired, and the sellers new line of products using the trademark within the limitations period was not shown to edge closer to the buyer in product similarity to warrant a new period of limitations. East West, LLC v. Rahman, 873 F. Supp. 2d 721, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78205 (E.D. Va. 2012). Adequate allegations of fals e advertising.  Plaintiff car dealerships former owners claim under § 8.01-221 against defendants, a car manufacturer and its financing division, failed to state a cla im as § 8.01-221 did not create a separate private action for the alleged Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act claims predicate acts, and while § 59.1-68.3 provided private actions for false advertising under §§ 18.2-216 and 18.2-217, there were no allegations on the nature of such advertising, and an executives alleged false credentials in a resume was insufficient. Field v. GMAC LLC, 660 F. Supp. 2d 679, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110164 (E.D. Va. 2008), aff'd, 328 Fed. Ap px. 873, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 16460 (4th Cir. 2009). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS A criminal conviction is not a prerequisite to recovery under §§ 18.2-216 and 59.1 -68.3.Va. Beach Rehab Specialists, Inc. v. Augustine Med., Inc., 58 Va. Cir. 379, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 155 (Norfolk Mar. 19, 2002). Action barred by statute of limita tions.  Count asserting that defendants violated Virginias False Advertising Statute, § 18.2-216, was barred by the statute of limitations of § 8.01-248 because more than two years had passed between the accrual of the cause of action and the filing of the motion for judgment. Fix v. Eakin/Youngtob Assocs., 61 Va. Cir. 604, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 95 (Alexandria Feb. 15, 2002). Plaintiffs claim that defendant violated § 18.2-216 was time-barred under § 8.01-248, as plaintiffs suffered loss not when they discovered damag es allegedly caused by defendants defective insulation product, but either when that product was chosen by the builders or installed by the subcontractor, as plaintiffs did not receive the quality product and construction contemplated by the contract ual relationship with the builder and subcontractor. Lesner Pointe Condo. Ass'n v. Harbour Point Bldg. Corp., 61 Va. Cir. 609, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 424 (Virginia Beach Apr. 10, 2002). Action not barred by statute of limitations.  Limited liability companys plea in bar to buyers false advertising claim was overruled because the § 8.01-248 two-year statute of limitations began to run on date the home sale went to settlement rather than the contract date, and the suit was thus timely; the buyers did not suffer a loss until they purchased the home, and the purchase was not complete until settlement. Brown v. Labelle, 84 Va. Cir. 25 8, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 23 (Fairfax County Feb. 2, 2012). Intent to sell.  Home buyers who contracted to have a home built failed to sufficiently state a cause of action for a violation of § 18.2-216, where the home buyers failed to a llege that the information concerning the home builders expertise was published with the intent to sell or to induce the public to enter into an obligation.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Adequate allegation of false a dvertising.  By providing buyers with literature to induce them to purchase one of its modular homes, and inducing them to contract with a builder, a manufacturer created a ne xus between the buyers and builder; therefore, the buyers could bring a false advertising claim against the manufacturer under §§ 18.2-216 and 18.2-217, even though it was not a party to the contract between the buyers and builder.

CASE NOTES Compensation.  Where the evidence showed that the predominant theme of the songs, cheers, printed materials, and tape recordings used at defendants seminar and workshop was that a new recruit could utilize the marketing phase of the program to recoup any investment he might make in the program, and recruits were told they could earn a large profit simply by inducing others to invest and participate in the program, both in p romise and in performance, the commissions were compensation within the intendment of subdivision (a) [now subdivision (4)] of this section. Bell v. Commonwealth, 236 Va. 298, 374 S.E.2d 13, 5 Va. Law Rep. 902, 1988 Va. LEXIS 141 (1988). Valuable consideration.  Although recruits were not required to pay defendant corporation their own money in order to acquire the opportunity to earn commissions, where they suffered a de triment in time and effort and conferred a benefit upon that corporation in the process of earning such opportunity, recruits were required to give valuable consideration within the meaning of subdivision (a) [now subdivision (4)] of this section . Bell v. Commonwealth, 236 Va. 298, 374 S.E.2d 13, 5 Va. Law Rep. 902, 1988 Va. LEXIS 141 (1988). Pyramid sales scheme does not indicate requirement of compensa tion flowing to intermediate participants.  Neither the dictionary definition nor the statutory definition of a pyramid sales scheme indicates that there must be a multi-layered vertical chain of co mpensation flowing to intermediate participants from the efforts of their recruits. Love v. Durastill of Richmond, Inc., 242 Va. 186, 408 S.E.2d 892, 8 Va. Law Rep. 945, 1991 Va. LEXIS 125 (1991). Company was a pyramid promotional scheme under this section where although a recruit was not required to pay company any of his own money in order to acquire the opportunity to earn commissions, he conferred a benefit, a valuable consideration, upon the company in the process of persuading others to make purchases. Bell v. Commonwealth, 236 Va. 298, 374 S.E.2d 13, 5 Va. Law Rep. 902, 1988 Va. LEXIS 141 (1988). Water purification system companys scheme was within the language of the statutory definition of a pyramid promotional scheme because it utilized a pyramid or chain process that placed the company at the apex of a pyramid resting upon a base of distributors who had been enticed into paying the company $5,000 for the ever-decreasing opportunity to recoup their investment by recruiting other distributors. Love v. Durastill of Richmond, Inc., 242 Va. 186, 408 S.E.2d 892, 8 Va. Law Rep. 945, 1991 Va. LEXIS 125 (1991). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Participation in gifting program is violation of statute.  Every person who participates in a gifting program by paying $2,000, with the expectation of advancing and ultimately receiving $16,000, is guilty of a Cl ass 1 misdemeanor for operating a pyramid promotional scheme.

CASE NOTES Meaning of subject to abuse.  An imitation controlled substance, as defined by subsection B, must be one which has a disposition or tendency to be misused. Rhodes v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 473, 404 S.E.2d 522, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2563, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 99 (1991). Trial court properly convicted defendant of distributing an imitation controlled substance because the evidence was sufficient to establish that, while defendant distributed a controlled substance to a detective, it was a Schedule VI controlled substance, which was not a controlled substance subject to abuse as defined by the Drug Control Act, the substance, by appearance and packaging, would likely be mi staken for crack cocaine, and defendant implied that the substance was 40 dollars worth of cocaine. Powell v. Commonwealth, 289 Va. 20, 766 S.E.2d 736, 2015 Va. LEXIS 1 (2015). Imitation controlled substance.  Court did not err by finding sufficient evidence that defendant distributed an imitation controlled substance, because defendants representations regarding th e substance, together with the packaging of the substance in a plastic knotted baggie, made it likely that the substance would be mistaken for crack cocaine; not only was the appearance of the substance consistent with crack cocaine when it was wrapped i n the plastic baggie, defendant implied it was crack cocaine. Powell v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. App. 579, 750 S.E.2d 229, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 342 (2013), aff'd, 289 Va. 20, 766 S.E.2d 736, 2015 Va. LEXIS 1 (2015). Defendant was properly convicted of possession with intent to distribute an imitation Schedule I/II controlled substance because the crystal-like substance found in small individually wrapped baggies upon the passenger of the vehicle that defendant was operating, by appearance and packaging, would likely have been mistaken for MDMA, otherwise known as molly, and defendant and the passenger, together, procured and packaged the substance, Himalayan salts, to look like molly. Riddle v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 314 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 15, 2016). Circuit court properly convicted defendant of possession with intent to distribute an imitation controlled substance because he possessed a substance that resembl ed heroin, was packaged to resemble heroin, and he arranged to sell it as heroin, the introduction into commerce exception was not applicable where specifically provided that the Commonwealth was not required to negative any exception, an d defendant failed to introduce any evid...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-248"><akn:num>§ 18.2-248</akn:num><akn:heading>Manufacturing, selling, giving, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture, sell, give, or distribute a controlled substance or an imit ation controlled substance prohibited; penalties</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

The offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person; d. The person was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense, and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise as defined in subsection I; and e. Not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the person has truthfully provided to the Commonwealth all information and evidence the person has concerning the offense or off enses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the person has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Commonwealth already is aware of the information shall not preclude a determ ination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement. C1. Any person who violates this section with respect to the manufacturing of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of its isomers or less than 200 grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of its isomers shall, upon conviction, be imprisoned for not less than 10 nor more than 40 years and fined not more than $500,000. Upon a second conviction of such a violation, any such person may, in the discretion of the court or jury imposing the sent ence, be sentenced to imprisonment for life or for any period not less than 10 years, and be fined not more than $500,000. When a person is convicted of a third or subsequent offense under this subsection and it is alleged in the warrant, indictment, or information that he has been previously convicted of two or more such offenses or of substantially similar offenses in any other jurisdiction, which offenses would be felonies if committed in the Commonwealth and such prior convictions occurred before th e date of the offense alleged in the warrant, indictment, or information, he shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life or for a period not less than 10 years, three years of which shall be a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment to be served consecuti vely with any other sentence and he shall be fined not more than $500,000.Upon conviction, in addition to any other punishment, a person found guilty of this offense shall be ordered by the court to make restitution, as the court deems appropriate, to an y innocent property owner whose property is damaged, destroyed, or otherwise rendered unusable as a result of such methamphetamine production. This restitution shall include the persons or his estates estimated or actual expenses associated with cleanup, removal, or repair of the affected property. If the property that is damaged, destroyed, or otherwise rendered unusable as a result of such methamphetamine production is property owned in whole or in part by the person convicted, the court shall order the person to pay to the Methamphetamine Cleanup Fund authorized in § 18.2-248.04 the reasonable estimated or actual expenses associated with cleanup, removal, or repair of the affected property or, if actual or estimated expenses cannot be det ermined, the sum of $10,000.

I.General Consideration. Constitutionality.  Since there is no fundamental right to the private use, possession or trade in marijuana or cocaine, and since governments have the power to enact and enforce sum ptuary laws in this area, § 18.2-248, now amended and cited as § 18.2-248.1 and this section do not violate the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.Wolkind v. Selph, 495 F. Supp. 507, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12565 (E.D. Va. 1 980), aff'd, 649 F.2d 865 (4th Cir. 1981). Since the classification of cocaine as a narcotic drug passes constitutional muster under the rational basis test, the penalty imposed by this section for the possession of cocaine as a Schedule II drug is not irrational, arbitrary or unjust and does not deny equal protection of the laws. Wolkind v. Selph, 495 F. Supp. 507, 1980 U.S. D ist. LEXIS 12565 (E.D. Va. 1980), aff'd, 649 F.2d 865 (4th Cir. 1981). Private possession of marijuana is not a fundamental constitutional right and the privat e possession of cocaine is not a fundamental constitutional right; accordingly, Virginias statutory framework establishing criminal penalties for the possession with the intent to distribute marijuana and for the simple possession of cocaine need bea r only a rational relationship to a legitimate interest of the Commonwealth. Wolkind v. Selph, 495 F. Supp. 507, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12565 (E.D. Va. 1980), aff'd, 649 F.2d 865 (4th Cir. 1981). Subjective intent to purchase.  Purchase of a noncontrolled substance that defendant subjectively believes to be a controlled substance can constitute an attempt to possess provided the governme nt proves the defendants subjective intent to purchase actual narcotics beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 626, 432 S.E.2d 1, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1584, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 215 (1993). Venue proper.  Trial court did not err in finding that venue was proper in Franklin County, Virginia because the evidence was more than sufficient to meet the lesser standard re quired to establish venue in Franklin County since defendant, the heroin she purchased, and her car in which the heroin was stored were all in the County the day of her arrest; because defendant knew the heroin was in her car, the evidence was more than sufficient to prove she constructively possessed heroin in Franklin County. Buck v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 153 (Va. Ct. App. July 2, 2019). Possession coextensive with § 18.2-248 possession.  Under the Virginia statutes, possession under this section is coextensive with possession under § 18.2-248. Such an interpretation is required as a matter of d ue process of law since, otherwise, a defendant could be subject to a presumption of possession based upon occupancy of an apartment in a prosecution under the greater offense of § 18.2-248, whereas such a presumption would be barred in a prosecution under this section. Bentley v. Cox, 508 F. Supp. 870, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10826 (E.D. Va. 1981). Double jeopardy.  Two convictions for possession of drugs with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school under § 18.2-255.2 did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause u nder U.S. Const., Amend. V and Va. Const., Art. I, § 8 as marijuana and cocaine were treated in the Virginia Code as separate and discrete illegal substances under §§ 18.2-250, 18.2-250.1, and 54.1-3448. Fullwood v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. App. 153 , 676 S.E.2d 348, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 224 (2009), aff'd, 279 Va. 531, 689 S.E.2d 742, 2010 Va. LEXIS 39 (2010). Possession is a lesser-included offense of distribution.  Proof of the elements of the offense of feloniously, knowingly, and intentionally distributing a controlled substance necessarily encompasses proof of the possess ion of that same controlled substance and, therefore, the offense of possessing a controlled substance is a lesser-included offense of distribution of a controlled substance. Austin v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 124, 531 S.E.2d 637, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 57 2 (2000). Evidence was insufficient to support defendants conviction for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute pursuant to § 18.2-248; there was no evi dence presented at defendants bench trial that the cocaine residue that police found in a raid on the residence where defendant lived with other people was the remainder of a larger supply that was intended for distribution; accordingly, the judgment of conviction had to be reversed and the case had to be remanded to allow the trial court to enter an order finding defendant guilty of possession of cocaine. Lunceford v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 98 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 21, 2006). Violation of this section is crime involving moral turpitude and oil company could reaso nably terminate cocaine users franchise. Portaluppi v. Shell Oil Co., 684 F. Supp. 900, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3077 (E.D. Va. 1988), aff'd, 869 F.2d 245, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 2828 (4th Cir. 1989). The jury should not concern itself with background information on the prohibited substance, but should make an objective finding of guilt or innocence based on relevant evidence and punish the guilty within the limits fixed by statute. Smith v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 721, 292 S.E.2d 362, 1982 Va. LEXIS 259 (1982). To permit evidence respecting extreme horrors which may result from the use of illegal substances diverts the jury from its principal inquiry and injects an eleme nt of passion into the trial prejudicial to the accused. Smith v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 721, 292 S.E.2d 362, 1982 Va. LEXIS 259 (1982). In determining whether a defendant constructively possessed drugs, defendants proxim ity to the drugs and his occupancy of the vehicle must also be considered. Although mere proximity to the drugs is insufficient to establish possession, and occupancy of the vehicle does not give rise to a presumption of possession, § 18.2-250, both are factors which may be considered in determining whether a defendant possessed drugs. Castaneda v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 574, 376 S.E.2d 82, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1611, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 6 (1989).

Persons charged with first offense may be placed on probation; conditions; substance abuse screening, assessment treatment and education programs o r services; drug tests; costs and fees; violations; discharge. Text Whenever any person who has not previously been convicted of any criminal offense under this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana, or stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic drugs, or has not previously had a proceeding against him for violation of such an offense dismissed as provided in this section, or pleads guilty to or enters a plea of not guilty to possession of a controlled substance under § 18.2-250, the court, upon such plea if the facts found by the court would justify a finding of guilt, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedi ngs and place him on probation upon terms and conditions. If the court defers further proceedings, at that time the court shall determine whether the clerk of court has been provided with the fingerprint identification information or fingerprints of the person, taken by a law-enforcement officer pursuant to § 19.2-390, and, if not, shall order that the fingerprints and photograph of the person be taken by a law-enforcement officer. As a term or condition, the court shall require the accused to undergo a substance abuse assessment pursuant to § 18.2-251.01 or 19.2-299.2, as appropriate, and ente r treatment and/or education program or services, if available, such as, in the opinion of the court, may be best suited to the needs of the accused based upon consideration of the substance abuse assessment. The program or services may be located in the judicial district in which the charge is brought or in any other judicial district as the court may provide. The services shall be provided by (i) a program licensed by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, by a similar program which is made available through the Department of Corrections, (ii) a local community-based probation services agency established pursuant to § 9.1-174, or (iii) an ASAP program certified by the Commission on VASAP. The court shall require the person entering such program under the provisions of this section to pay all or part of the costs of the program, including the costs of the screening, assessment, testing, and treatment, based upon the accuseds ability to pay unless the person is determined by the court to be indigent. As a condition of probation, the court shall require the accused (a) to successfully complete treatment or education program or services, (b) to remain drug and alcohol free during the period of probation and submit to such tests during that period as may be necessary and appropriate to determine if the accused is drug and alcohol free, (c) to make reasonable efforts to secure and maintain employment, and (d) to comply with a plan of at least 100 hours of community service for a felony and up to 24 hours of community service for a misdemeanor. Such testing shall be conducted by personnel of the supervising probation agency or personnel of any program or agency approve d by the supervising probation agency. Upon violation of a term or condition, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, and upon determining that the clerk of court has been provided with the fingerprint identification information or fingerprints of such person, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against him. Discharge and dismissal under this s ection shall be without adjudication of guilt and is a conviction only for the purposes of applying this section in subsequent proceedings. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, whenever a court places an individual on probation upon terms and conditions pursuant to this section, such action shall be treated as a conviction for purposes of § 22.1-315. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable to any offense for which a juvenile has had his license suspended or denied pursuant to § 16.1-278.9 for the same offense. History History.

The General Assembly recognizes that there is a critical need in the Commonwealth for effective treatment programs that reduce the incidence of drug use, drug addiction, family separation due to parental substance abuse, and drug-related crimes. It is the intent of the General Assembly by this section to enhance public safety by facilitating the creation of drug treatment courts as means by which to accomplish this purpose. C. The goals o f drug treatment courts include: (i) reducing drug addiction and drug dependency among offenders; (ii) reducing recidivism; (iii) reducing drug-related court workloads; (iv) increasing personal, familial and societal accountability among offenders; and, (v) promoting effective planning and use of resources among the criminal justice system and community agencies. D. Drug treatm ent courts are specialized court dockets within the existing structure of Virginias court system offering judicial monitoring of intensive treatment and strict supervision of addicts in drug and drug-related cases. Local officials must complete a rec ognized planning process before establishing a drug treatment court program. E. Administrat ive oversight for implementation of the Drug Treatment Court Act shall be conducted by the Supreme Court of Virginia. The Supreme Court of Virginia shall be responsible for (i) providing oversight for the distribution of funds for drug treatment courts; (ii) providing technical assistance to drug treatment courts; (iii) providing training for judges who preside over drug treatment courts; (iv) providing training to the providers of administrative, case management, and treatment services to drug treatmen t courts; and (v) monitoring the completion of evaluations of the effectiveness and efficiency of drug trea...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-255"><akn:num>§ 18.2-255</akn:num><akn:heading>Distribution of certain drugs to persons under 18 prohibited; penalty</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 6B M.J. Drugs &amp; Duggists, § 5; 9B M.J. Infants &amp; Juvenile s, § 90. CASE NOTES Authenticated court order reliable evidence of juvenile status.  The recommended and customary practice of circuit courts in determining and recording in the authenticated conviction order a criminal defendants age or date of birth gives the recorded fact sufficient reliability and trustworthiness to render the order competent to prove accomplices age in prosecution under this section. Parker v. Commonwealth, No. 0406-93-1 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 16, 1994). No req uirement that defendant know age of drug purchaser.  Trial court was correct in refusing to grant defendants motion to strike the charge of knowing or intentional distribution of cocaine to persons under 18 year s of age even though defendant did not have actual knowledge of drug purchasers age; the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant knowingly or intentionally distributed a controlled drug, and the statute does not require proof that the d efendant knew the age of his drug purchaser. Pannell v. Commonwealth, 9 Va. App. 170, 384 S.E.2d 344, 6 Va. Law Rep. 669, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 133 (1989). Proof of age of purchaser.  The trial court did not err in allowing the Commonwealth to prove the age of the juvenile to whom the defendant sold cocaine by means of his driving record, and i t was not necessary to call the juvenile in order to establish his age. Hurley v. Commonwealth, No. 2794-97-3 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 2, 1999). Distribute.  Defendant was guilty of distributing controlled substance to a minor because he accomplished an actual transfer of drug to her, and fact that minor possessed drug for only a brief period of time did not undermine or diminish fact that she actually possessed it. Morris v. Commonwealth, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 629 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 1999). Attempt to distribute marijuana.  Where evidence showed: (1) discussions were held on three separate occasions between defendant/seller and juvenile/purchaser regarding when and how much marijuana could be obtained; (2) parties met at a prearranged location for transfer of marijuana; (3) defendant/seller had some marijuana on hand; (4) but a misunderstanding regarding the amount of drugs to be sold prevented consummation of the sale, evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant intended and attempted to distribute marijuana to juvenile for further distribution. Wescoat v. Commonwealth, No. 1256-98-2 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 15, 2000). Parent giving prescription drug to child.  Parents conviction for giving a controlled substance that had been prescribed for her to her minor children was upheld where the defendant told a detective th at she gave the medication to her children in orange juice, described the specific amount she gave to each child and said that she knew that the dosage she gave the children would not harm them but would make them drowsy, and where the corroborating test imony of the children was that the defendant gave them pills mixed with orange juice and one child stated that she had told him that the drug would make him sleepy and take things off his mind. Moellar v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 685 (Va. Ct. Ap p. Oct. 3, 2000). Venue.  Because causing a juvenile to assist in the distribution of marijuana in violation of clause (ii) of subsection A of § 18.2-255 was a continuing offense, venue was proper in the county where the juvenile sold the marijuana pursuant to § 19.2-244. Kelso v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. App. 30, 698 S.E.2d 263, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 350 (2010), aff'd, 282 Va. 134, 710 S.E.2d 470, 2011 Va. LEXIS 128 (2011). Venue over charges for three counts of causing a juvenile to assist in the distribution of marijuana to a third party, in violation of clause (ii) of subsection A of § 18.2-255, was proper in Hanover County where the nature of the crime was not that of a continuing crime, but one in which different elements of a single crime occur in different jurisdictions, and the record clearly showed that the juvenile dist ributed the marijuana he received from defendant to a third party in Hanover County. Kelso v. Commonwealth, 282 Va. 134, 710 S.E.2d 470, 2011 Va. LEXIS 128 (2011). Hearsay test imony as to defendants age was harmless.  Defendants challenge to an arresting officers hearsay testimony as to defendants age for purposes of this section was harmless as defense counsel conc eded that defendant identified his date of birth during the preliminary proceedings; further, defendants presence during the trial afforded the trial court an opportunity to determine defendants approximate age. Eley v. Va., 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 5 32 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2004). Juvenile court petition was properly admitted as evidence of a minors age for purposes of a § 18.2-255 conviction as the legislature had determined that of ficial records were admissible as prima facie evidence if properly authenticated; defendant did not challenge the authenticity of the petition or contend that it was not an official or judicial record. Eley v. Va., 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 532 (Va. Ct. App. N ov. 9, 2004). Sufficiency of the evidence.  Where the evidence reflected that defendants accomplice was a minor and that the cocaine found in a vehicle was given to the driver by the accomplice, who rec eived it from defendant, the evidence was sufficient to support defendants convictions for possession and distribution of cocaine. Battle v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 124 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 23, 2004). There was sufficient evidence to sustain defendants convictions for violating § 18.2-255 for knowingly giving defendants daughter and her friend morphi ne and another drug. Symptoms experienced by the daughter and her friend were consistent with the side effects often experienced after taking those drugs, according to a toxicologist. Wiley v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 106 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 4, 2 008). Sentencing.  Where appellant pled guilty to a charge of distributing an imitation controlled substance to a minor at least three years his junior, the trial court did not abus e its discretion in sentencing appellant to two years of incarceration because the sentence was within the range set by the legislature under Va. Code Ann. §§ 18.2-10(f), -255(B). Boyd v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 409 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 30, 2022). § 18.2-255.1.

Otherwise , criminals would be encouraged to plot a number of drug-related crimes simultaneously, because only one conspiracy would exist. This could not have been the intention of the General Assembly. Wooten v. Commonwealth, 235 Va. 89, 368 S.E.2d 693, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2018, 1988 Va. LEXIS 18 (1988). Proof.  Existence of conspiracy to distribute between seller and buyer, has been proved if, evidence demonstrates: (1) that seller knows buyers intended illegal use; and (2) that by the sale the seller intends to further, promote and cooperate in venture. Zuniga v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 523, 375 S.E.2d 381, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1246, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 132 (1988). Second element of conspiracy to distribute must be proved since not every instance of sa le of restricted goods, harmful as are opiates, in which seller knows buyer intends to use them unlawfully, will support charge of conspiracy, and proof of second element establishes necessary preconcert and connivance which places conduct beyond aiding and abetting. Zuniga v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 523, 375 S.E.2d 381, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1246, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 132 (1988). Defend ant need only know essential nature of conspiracy.  Where defendant knew that coconspirator was planning to go into Virginia to sell narcotics and that sale would enable coconspirator to return following night and pay amount advanced on credit evidence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine did not need to show defendant knew entire scope or details of plan of distribution; evidence needed only to show that he knew of essential nature of scheme. Zuniga v. Commonweal th, 7 Va. App. 523, 375 S.E.2d 381, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1246, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 132 (1988). No n eed to prove sustained course of conduct in conspiracy.  Where case involved conspiracy to distribute cocaine, although evidence did not establish that there was regular, sustained and prolonged course of conduc t between defendant and coconspirator, such course of conduct did not need to be proved, since commodity was per se unlawful. Zuniga v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 523, 375 S.E.2d 381, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1246, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 132 (1988). Conspi ring with police officer and officers informant.  An accused may not be convicted under this section for conspiring to distribute cocaine with a police officer and the officers confidential informant. Fortune v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 643, 406 S.E.2d 47, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2924, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 134 (1991). Conspiring with in formant who was agent of police.  The evidence was insufficient to prove the existence of a conspiracy between appellant and A. During both transactions for which appellant with charged with consp iracy, A was working as a confidential informant  an agent of the police. Because A was not a bona fide co-conspirator, there could be no meeting of the minds as a matter of law between him and appellant to distribute heroin to detect ive. Levi v. Commonwealth, No. 2640-96-2 (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 16, 1997). Evidence of acts of co-conspirators.  Where the Commonwealths evidence established a prima facie case of conspiracy, the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of acts of co-conspirators in furtherance of that conspiracy. Barber v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 172, 360 S.E.2d 888, 4 Va. Law Rep. 745, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 231 (1987). Evidence of another conspiracy was properly admitted to prove defendants intent and to show that both conspiracies were part of a common scheme or plan. Barber v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 172, 360 S.E.2d 888, 4 Va. Law Rep. 745, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 231 (1987). Evidence that defendants constructively possessed cocaine was probative of the object of the conspiracy. Hodge v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 351, 374 S.E.2d 76, 5 Va. Law Rep. 829, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 120 (1988). Acts in furtherance of con spiracy held shown.  Where each transaction involved defendant, alleged co-conspirator, and others and occurred at approximately the same time, and resulted in the commingling of the two loads of marijuana, the nature and scope of the activities set forth in the indictment involved the identical offenses of possession and distribution of marijuana, a pattern of mutual cooperation took place among the various parties, and both transac tions involved an agreement between defendant and alleged co-conspirator in which alleged co-conspirator agreed to store marijuana for defendant until defendant distributed it, the evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to establish that the activiti es relating to the marijuana obtained from another alleged co-conspirators residence were acts in furtherance of a single conspiracy. Barber v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 172, 360 S.E.2d 888, 4 Va. Law Rep. 745, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 231 (1987). All drug conspiracies not same.  The legislature, in enacting this section, determined that all drug conspiracies are not the same. Conspiracies to commit more serious drug offenses are to be pun ished more severely. Wooten v. Commonwealth, 235 Va. 89, 368 S.E.2d 693, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2018, 1988 Va. LEXIS 18 (1988). In order to convict defendant of conspiring to distribute a controlled drug, the Commonw ealth had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an agreement existed between the two men by some concerted action to distribute the drugs. Reed v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 593, 194 S.E.2d 746, 1973 Va. LEXIS 189 (1973) (see Johnson v. Commonwealth, 42 Va. App. 46, 590 S.E.2d 75, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 673 (2003)). Chain of custody established.  Trial court properly admitted into evidence two certificates of analysis as evidence of the chain of custody of the drugs seized during the drug sales under § 19.2-187.01 in defendants trial for possession with intent to distribute under § 18.2-248, and conspiring to distribute a controlled substance under § 18.2-256 where: (1) the initials on the postal receipts matched those on the Request for Labo ratory Examination; (2) a police officer mailed the narcotics to the Virginia Division of Forensic Science, which verified its receipt by executing the Request for Laboratory Examination; (3) the receipt alone established prima facie evidence of the chai n of custody; and (4) that the initials on the postal receipts were not consistent with the signatures on the two Requests for Laboratory Examination did not undermine the statutory inference under § 19.2-187.01.Martin v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. L EXIS 341 (Va. Ct. App. June 17, 2003). Evidence of prior bad acts.  Defendants convictions for possession with intent to distribute marijuana under § 18.2-248.1 and conspiracy to distribute marijuana under §§ 18.2-256 and 18.2-248.1 were proper because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of defendants other bad acts as part of a common scheme or plan to support his current convictions. The evidence was relevant and admissible to sho w a course of conduct entered into by defendant to sell marijuana through his middleman and it proved that he committed similar acts with similar results. Pinnix v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 149 (Va. Ct. App. May 3, 2011). Proof of agreement to distribute.  Where the indictment charged defendant with a conspiracy to distribute more than one-half ounce of marijuana, one of the felonies defined in § 18.2-248.1, the Commonwealth was required to prove an agreement to distribute a proscribed substance and to prove both the identity and the quantity of the substance contemplated by the agreement. Graves v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 578, 363 S.E.2d 705, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1540, 1988 Va. LEXIS 16 (1988). Accomplice testimony was sufficiently corroborated to support conviction.  An accomplices testimony was sufficiently corroborated by a police investigator and a confidential informant who taped a sales transaction. Johnson v. Commonw ealth, 42 Va. App. 46, 590 S.E.2d 75, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 673 (2003). Evidence held sufficient to support conviction of conspiracy, etc. Evidence held sufficient to support conviction of conspiracy to sell, give, or distribut e cocaine in violation of § 18.2-248 and this section. Hodge v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 351, 374 S.E.2d 76, 5 Va. Law Rep. 829, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 120 (1988); Gonzales-Loya v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 458 (Va. Ct. App. June 20, 2000). Both parts of the Zuniga test (see Zuniga v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 523, 375 S.E.2d 381 (1988)) for determining the presence of a conspiracy in a sale of a controlled substance were met where from the two statements the defendant made during the transaction c oncerning his knowledge of what partner intended to do with the marijuana and his expectation of sharing in the profits of partners sale of the marijuana. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 45, 441 S.E.2d 351, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1064, 1994 Va. App. LE XIS 133 (1994). Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction of aiding and abetting prescription fraud in violation of § 18.2-258.1 where: (1) defendants g irlfriend falsely told the pharmacist that she had not had received the pain medication, including a Schedule II controlled substance under § 54.1-3448, and the pha...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-257"><akn:num>§ 18.2-257</akn:num><akn:heading>Attempts</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) Any person who attempts to commit any offense defined in this article or in the Drug Control Act (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.) which is a felony shall be imprisoned for not less than one nor more than ten years; provided, however, that any person convicted of attemptin g to commit a felony for which a lesser punishment may be imposed may be punished according to such lesser penalty. (b) Any person who attempts to commit any offense defined in this article or in the Drug Control Act which is a misdemeanor shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor; provided, however, that any person convicted of attempting to commit a misdemeanor for which a lesser punishment may be imposed may be punished according to such lesser penalty.

Annotations CASE NOTES Proof.  In a prosecution for an attempt to commit a crime, the Commonwealth must prove the accused had a specific intent to commit that crime. Smith v. Commonwealth, 16 V a. App. 626, 432 S.E.2d 1, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1584, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 215 (1993). Purchase of a noncontrolled substance that defendant subjectively believes to be a controlled substance can constitute an attempt to possess provided the governme nt proves the defendants subjective intent to purchase actual narcotics beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 626, 432 S.E.2d 1, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1584, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 215 (1993). Second element of conspiracy to distribute must be proved since not every instance of sa le of restricted goods, harmful as are opiates, in which seller knows buyer intends to use them unlawfully, will support charge of conspiracy, and proof of second element establishes necessary preconcert and connivance which places conduct beyond aiding and abetting. Zuniga v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 523, 375 S.E.2d 381, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1246, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 132 (1988). Defend ant need only know essential nature of conspiracy.  Where defendant knew that coconspirator was planning to go into Virginia to sell narcotics and that sale would enable coconspirator to return following night and pay amount advanced on credit evidence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine did not need to show defendant knew entire scope or details of plan of distribution; evidence needed only to show that he knew of essential nature of scheme.

No n eed to prove sustained course of conduct in conspiracy.  Where case involved conspiracy to distribute cocaine, although evidence did not establish that there was regular, sustained and prolonged course of conduc t between defendant and coconspirator, such course of conduct did not need to be proved, since commodity was per se unlawful. Zuniga v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 523, 375 S.E.2d 381, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1246, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 132 (1988). Factual impossibility not a defense.  Where defendant had completed every act necessary for commission of the substantive crime, and the only reason the distribution was not a crime was a defect in th e substance itself, which was unknown to defendant, the impossibility was clearly factual, not legal, and as such, could not be asserted as a defense to the attempted crime. Parham v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 633, 347 S.E.2d 172, 3 Va. Law Rep. 198, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 316 (1986). No error in amendment which substituted this section for § 18.2-26.  Where prior to trial, the trial court granted the Commonwealths motion to amend second count of indictment, and where the nature of the amendment changed the attempt statute on which the Commonwealth was relying from § 18.2-26, the general attempt statute, to this section, which covers attempts to violate the Drug Control Act, the trial court did not err in granting the Commonwealths motion to amend th e indictment against defendant. The amendment did not change the nature or character of the offense charged; it merely substituted reference to this section, the specific provision covering attempts to commit drug offenses, for § 18.2-26, the general provision covering attempts to commit general, non-capital felonies. Robinson v. Commonwealth, No. 1840-90-1 (Ct. of Appeals July 21, 1992). Evidence held suff icient to prove second element.  Evidence demonstrated that by sale defendant intended to further, promote and cooperate in coconspirators venture, where defendant had stake in venture becaus e, by extending credit, defendant stood to make profits which came from encouragement of coconspirators illicit operations. Zuniga v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 523, 375 S.E.2d 381, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1246, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 132 (1988). Where by selling cocaine to coconspirator and receiving partial payment of less than agreed price, defendant retained interest in and maintained continuing partic ipation in coconspirators venture, where by advancing cocaine on credit and insuring that coconspirator could perform his obligations, defendant actively became partner in venture, and where evidence supported finding that defendant was drug dealer w ho agreed to credit arrangement with coconspirator, another drug dealer, in hope of promoting future dealings, acts evinced agreement between and concert of action by parties sufficient to prove conspiracy beyond reasonable doubt. Zuniga v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 523, 375 S.E.2d 381, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1246, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 132 (1988). Sufficiency of the evidence.  Because the record clearly established that the term twenty referred to cocaine and not marijuana, the trial judge correctly found that a police video and a police officers testimony were sufficient to convict defendant of attempted distribution of cocaine. Turner v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 368 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 27, 2005). Evidence supported defendants conviction for attempt to manufacture, sell, give, distribute or attempt to possess with intent to manufacture, sell, give, or d istribute a Schedule I or II controlled substance because it was reasonable to infer from the evidence that defendant specifically intended to possess cocaine and to distribute it to an informant and others who provided money to defendant. Folly v. Commo nwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 273 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 5, 2014). Illegal search.  Defendants suppression motion was improperly denied as police searched defendant for illegal substances, not for weapons, in Terry stop, and were not followin g leads prior to their misconduct, making the doctrine of inevitable discovery inapplicable; the white powder found on defendant during the search should have been suppressed.

CASE NOTES Use of premises for possession and distribution of marijuana.  This section very clearly requires: (1) That the owner of the premises have knowledge that it is being frequented for the purpose of the illegal possession and di stribution of marijuana and (2) That the owner knowingly permit, keep or maintain the nuisance. Peace v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 725 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 14, 2000). Insufficient evidence that activity permitted by defendant.  The mother of a 15 year-old son did not establish, keep, or maintain the family home for the purpose of allowing the son and his friends t o smoke marijuana in the garage. By knowing about the illegal activity and allowing it to continue the defendant did not permit the activity in that the evidence showed no affirmative act or decided assent and very clearly indicated that the defe ndant became upset and discouraged the activity when she was confronted with it.

Text The attorney for the Commonwealth, or any citizen of the county, city, or town, where such a nuisance as is described in § 18.2-258 exists, may, in addition to the r emedies given in and punishment imposed by this chapter, maintain a suit in equity in the name of the Commonwealth to enjoin the same; provided, however, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall not be required to prosecute any suit brought by a citizen u nder this section. In every case where the bill charges, on the knowledge or belief of complainant, and is sworn to by two witnesses, that a nuisance exists as described in § 18.2-258, a temporary injunction may be granted as soon as the bill is pres ented to the court provided reasonable notice has been given. The injunction shall enjoin and restrain any owners, tenants, their agents, employees, and any other person from contributing to or maintaining the nuisance and may impose such other requirem ents as the court deems appropriate. If, after hearing, the court finds that the material allegations of the bill are true, although the premises complained of may not then be unlawfully used, it shall continue the injunction against such persons or pre mises for such period of time as it deems appropriate, with the right to dissolve the injunction upon a proper showing by the owner of the premises.

Drugs and Druggists, § 5. CASE NOTES Substantially altere d from its original status.  Supreme Court of Virginia does not set forth an all-encompassing definition of the phrase substantially altered from its original status as set forth in § 18.2-258.02, but, instead, recognizes that each case will turn upon its own peculiar facts. Jones v. Commonwealth, 276 Va. 121, 661 S.E.2d 412, 2008 Va. LEXIS 63 (2008). Insufficient evidence that structure was substantially altered from its original status.  Evidence was not sufficient to sustain defendants conviction for maintaining or operating a fortified drug house in violation of § 18.2-258.02 where althou gh the use of a stove and a 2x4 board wedged between a door and stairway, and a screwdriver inserted into the doors latch impeded the police, that use did not substantially alter the structure from its original status. Jones v. Commonwealth, 276 Va. 121, 661 S.E.2d 412, 2008 Va. LEXIS 63 (2008). § 18.2-258.1. Obtaining drugs, procuring administration of controlled substances, etc., by fraud, deceit or forgery. Text A. It shall be unlawful for any person to obtain or attempt to obtain any drug or procure or attempt to procure the administration of any controlled substance or marijuana: (i) by fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, embezzlement, or subterfuge; (ii) by the forgery or al teration of a prescription or of any written order; (iii) by the concealment of a material fact; or (iv) by the use of a false name or the giving of a false address.

C. It shall be unlawful for any person to use in the course of the manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance or marijuana a license number which is fictitious, revoked, suspended, or issued to another person. D. It shall be unlawful for any person, for the purpose of obtaining any controlled substance or marijuana to falsely assume the title of, or represent himself to be, a manufacturer, wholesaler, pharmacist, physician, dentist, veterinarian or other authorized person.

CASE NOTES This section does not extend transactional immunity to nondrug offenses. since, while th e statute extends use immunity to all prosecutions against a witness, this section provides transactional immunity only as to the offense as to which he testifies and the word offense as used in this context does not refer to any offense to which he may have at any time testified; it refers only to the offense or offenses for which he was compelled to testify under the terms of the statute. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 86, 379 S.E.2d 368, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2150, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1989). The transactional immunity from prosecution provided for in this section does not extend to nondrug related offenses about which a person may not be compelled to testify. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 86, 379 S.E.2d 368, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2150, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1989). The statute applies only to crimes involving illegal drugs and, therefore, did not apply in a robbery prosecution. Walton v. Commonwealth, No. 2471-97-1 (Ct. of A ppeals Mar. 30, 1999); Saab v. Commonwealth, No. 2472-97-1 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 30, 1999). Transactional immunity waived.  Trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to dismiss charges of possession with intent to distribute more than five pounds of marijuana and transpo rting more than five pounds of marijuana into the Commonwealth because defendant implicitly waived any transactional immunity he could have had under § 18.2-262 by agreeing to voluntarily testify for the Commonwealth; a waiver of the statutory right n eed not be a knowing and intelligent express waiver, but instead, a waiver of the provisions of this statute may be made implicitly. Murphy v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 535, 659 S.E.2d 538, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 180 (2008), aff'd, 277 Va. 221, 672 S.E.2d 884, 2009 Va. LEXIS 38 (2009). Controlling effect of § 19.2-215. 1 et seq.  In order to give full force and effect both to § 19.2-215.1 et seq., addressing the narrow, specific exemption for multi-jurisdictional grand juries, and to th is section, addressing grand juries generally, the later enacted statutory scheme (§ 19.2-215.1 et seq.) is construed to control testimony before multi-jurisdictional grand juries. Tharpe v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 37, 441 S.E.2d 228, 10 Va. Law Rep . 1055, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 111 (1994). The word offense refers to the earlier language in this section describing the o ffense for which a defendant was compelled to testify and this includes any offense alleged to have been committed by another under this article or under the Drug Control Act (§§ 54.1-3400 et seq.) but it is illogical to conclude that the G eneral Assembly intended to provide immunity for any crime about which a person may at any time testify even if he was not compelled to do so. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 86, 379 S.E.2d 368, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2150, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1989). The only offenses for which defendant was entitled to be immune from prosecution were th e two drug offenses for which her friend was being prosecuted when defendant testified since these two offenses were the only ones alleged to have been committed by another and for which defendants testimony was for the Commonwealth. Dunmyer v. Commo nwealth, No. 0091-89-4 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 13, 1990). Only compelled testimony a fforded immunity.  Immunity protections of § 18.2-262 apply only to witnesses whose testimony is compelled. Murphy v. Commonwealth, 277 Va. 221, 672 S.E.2d 884, 2009 Va. LEXIS 38 (2009). As defendants testimony at co-defendants preliminary hearing was voluntarily given in return for the prosecutions agreement to dismiss one of two pend ing charges, the transactional immunity provisions of § 18.2-2 62 did not entitle him to dismissal of another charge to which he had agreed to plead guilty.

CASE NOTES Burden of proving accommodation.  Section 18.2-248 and this section place the burden of proving the existence of an accommodation distribution (and the right to the lesser penalty) to the trier of fact on the shoulders of the defendant. In other words, the statute contains a presumption against an accommodation distribution to the extent that it is relevant to the determination of the proper degree of punishment, but only after guilt has been est ablished. Ulmer v. Commonwealth, No. 0369-85 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 26, 1986). Section reli eves Commonwealth of impossible burden.  This section takes note of the fact that a defendant is the person with the greatest knowledge and easiest access to evidence to show, for example, that his sale or distribution of a controlled substance was one of accommodation and not a commercial transaction, and therefore relieves the Commonwealth of what would amount to an impossible burden of affirmatively negating every exception, excuse, proviso or exempt ion claimed by a defendant. Stillwell v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 214, 247 S.E.2d 360, 1978 Va. LEXIS 181 (1978). Circuit court properly convicted defendant of possession with intent to distribute an imitation controlled substance because he possessed a substance that resembl ed heroin, was packaged to resemble heroin, and he arranged to sell it as heroin, the introduction into commerce exception was not applicable where specifically provided that the Commonwealth was not required to negative any exception, an d defendant failed to introduce any evidence of when any substance  imitation or illegal  was introduced into commerce. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 215 (Va. Ct. App. July 28, 2020). Presumption against accommodation continues until there is proof by a preponderance of t he evidence that the transaction was an accommodation distribution. Ulmer v. Commonwealth, No. 0369-85 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 26, 1986). Failure to meet burden of proof for accommodation instruction.  Defendants convictions for two counts of distribution of cocaine, third offense; three counts of distribution of marijuana; two counts of conspiracy to distri bute cocaine, third offense; three counts of conspiracy to distribute marijuana; one count of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute; and one count of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute were proper because the trial court did not err in not instructing the jury on the lesser punishment of distribution for accommodation. In each transaction, the agent was the buyer, and not the cousin, who had only arranged the meetings for the agent; additionally, the fact that defendant did not make any money on the transactions was not dispositive. Martin v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 205 (Va. Ct. App. May 18, 2010). Burden of proof of any exception, excuse, proviso, or exemption on defendant.  This section did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof to defendant, as the presence of a valid prescription was an affirmative defense, peculiarly within k nowledge of defendant, for which defendant had the burden of going forward with supporting evidence. Williams v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. App. 341, 702 S.E.2d 260, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 481 (2010). No exemption.  Where the defendant made no claim that he possessed a drug of unknown properties, or that it was a legal drug, or that he came into possession of it in a legal ma nner, he did not have any burden to prove that his possession, sale, or dispensing was lawful as an exemption to this chapter. He was under no burden to prove anything, and he could rely on his plea of not guilty. Walker v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 289, 183 S.E.2d 739, 1971 Va. LEXIS 349 (1971). Where the defendant made no claim that he possessed a drug of unknown properties, or that it was a legal drug, or that he came into possession of it in a legal ma nner, but rather he denied that he possessed or sold any drug, there was no exception, excuse, proviso or exemption involved in the case, and no occasion for any resort by the Commonwealth to the provisions of this section.

Text In determining whether an object is drug paraphernalia, the court may consider, in addition to all other relevant evidence, the following: 1. Const itutionally admissible statements by the accused concerning the use of the object; 2. The proximity of the object to marijuana or controlled substances, which proximity is actually known to the accused; 3. Instructions, oral or written, provided with the object concerning its use; 4. Descriptive materials accompanying the object which explain or depict its use; 5. National and local advertising within the actual knowledge of the accused concerning its use; 6. The manner in which the object is displayed for sale; 7. Whether the accused is a legitimate supplier of like or related items to the community, such as a licensed distributor or dealer of tobacco products; 8. Evidence of the ratio of sales of the objects defined in § 18.2-265.1 to the total sales of the business enterprise; 9. The existence and scope of legitimate uses for the object in the community; 10. Expert testimony concerning its use or the purpose for which it was designed; 11. Relevant evidence of the intent of the accused to deliver it to persons who he knows, or should reasonably know, intend to use the object with an illegal drug. The innocence of an o wner, or of anyone in control of the object, as to a direct violation of this article shall not prevent a finding that the object is intended for use or designed for use as drug paraphernalia.

Annotations Law Review. For note on Virginias drug paraphernalia law, see 16 U. Rich. L. Rev. 161 (1982). CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  This section was constitutional as applied to defendants conduct, because there was ample evidence in the record that defendant possessed drug paraphernalia w ith the intent to sell to nonprescription holders, conduct that was clearly prohibited by the statute, and defendants repeated insistence that he intended to sell items in his store only for tobacco use demonstrated that he was aware that selling the m for marijuana consumption was illegal.

Morrison v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 273, 557 S.E .2d 724, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 1 (2002). For a conviction for selling drug paraphernalia, the Commonwealth need prove only that defendant was aware when he sold the items, or possessed them with the inte nt to sell, that buyers in general are likely to use the items with illegal drugs, not that a particular buyer intended to use the items in this fashion.

The trial court properly treated § 18.2-266 as a permissive inference, explicitly stating so. Yap v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 622, 643 S.E.2d 523, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 171 (2007). Construction.  In construing this section and §§ 18.2-270 through 18.2-273 consideration must be given to the words used, their relation to the subject matter in which the y are used, the purposes for which the statute was intended, and the mischief sought to be suppressed. Commonwealth v. Ellett, 174 Va. 403, 4 S.E.2d 762, 1939 Va. LEXIS 160 (1939).

White v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 410, 494 S.E.2d 896, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 45 (1998). A conviction under § 18.2-36.1 requires proof both that the accused violated clauses (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section and that such misconduct caused the d eath of another, elements not necessary to common-law involuntary manslaughter. Section 18.2-36.1 C expressly provides that the provisions of § 18.2-36.1 shall not preclude prosecution under any other homicide statute. Stover v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. A pp. 225, 522 S.E.2d 397, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 713 (1999) (upholding defendants conviction under § 18.2-36 for involuntary manslaughter.). Definitions in § 46.2-100 do not control Title 18.2, and therefore, the definition of operator pursuant to § 46.2-100 was inapplicable where defendant was c onvicted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Reynolds v. City of Va. Beach, 31 Va. App. 629, 525 S.E.2d 65, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 133 (2000). The Virginia legislature intended to permit the imposition of multiple punishments for involuntary manslaughter while driving under the influence, under § 18.2 -36.1, and driving under the influence, under clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section upon convictions obtained in a single trial. Goodman v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 374, 558 S.E.2d 555, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 45 (2002). Trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to strike, which alleged that he could not have been prosecuted for felony child abuse for transporting h is son while driving under the influence, since § 18.2-270 simply provides an additional penalty for driving under the influence while transporting a person 17 years of age or younger and does not include within its parameters the elem...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-267"><akn:num>§ 18.2-267</akn:num><akn:heading>Preliminary analysis of breath to determine alcoholic content of blood</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

T he person shall also be entitled, upon request, to observe the process of analysis and to see the blood-alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test. His breath may be analyzed by any police officer of the Commonwealth, or of any coun ty, city or town, or by any member of a sheriffs department in the normal discharge of his duties. B. The Departm ent of Forensic Science shall determine the proper method and equipment to be used in analyzing breath samples taken pursuant to this section and shall advise the respective police and sheriffs departments of the same. C. Any person who has been stopped by a police officer of the Commonwealth, or of any county, city or town, or by any member of a sheriffs department and is suspected by such officer to be guilty of an offense listed in subsection A, shall have the right to refuse to permit his breath to be so analyzed, and his failure to permit such analysis shall not be evidence in any prosecution for an offense listed in subsection A. D. Whenever th e breath sample analysis indicates that alcohol is present in the persons blood, the officer may charge the person with a violation of an offense listed in subsection A.

CASE NOTES Admission of taking of alcosensor test, without admission of results of test.  It was not error for the court to permit the introduction of evidence that the defendant was offered and agreed to take an alcosensor test, that the arresting off icer saw the results of the test, and that the results formed a part of his basis for arresting the defendant, where the actual results of the test were not admitted into evidence. Crewey v. Commonwealth, No. 1288-97-3 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 22, 1998). Results of preliminary breath test inadmissible in prosecution under § 18.2-36.1.  By express wording of statute, a prosecution for violation of § 18.2-36.1 was necessarily a prosecution under § 18.2-266, and thus this section appl ied to bar results of preliminary breath test in prosecution under § 18.2-36.1.Hall v. Commonwealth, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 543 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 28, 1999). Preliminary breath test admissible.  Trial court did not err in admitting the result of defendants preliminary breath test at a suppression hearing because a police officer performed the prelimin ary breath test in the normal discharge of the officers duties using the proper method and equipment. The officer used a preliminary breath testing device approved for use by the Virginia Department of Forensic Science, learned to operate the prelimi nary breath testing device during field training, and administered the test to defendant in accordance with the officers training. Aloudah v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 37 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 13, 2018). Admission of refusal to perform test did not violate constitutions.  Neither the Fifth Amendment nor Va. Const., Art. I, § 8 were violated by the admission in evidence of defendants refusal to take a field sobriety test. Far mer v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 337, 404 S.E.2d 371, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2425, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (1991). Trial court appropriately concluded that the information that defendant received did not violate his right to due process because, in accordance with the statute, the officer specifically told defendant that refusing the breath test would constitute a separate civil or criminal offense. Because the officer advised defendant of precisely what he was required to tell him regarding the implications of refusal to tak e the breath test, the due process principle relied on did not apply. Park v. Commonwealth, 74 Va. App. 635, 871 S.E.2d 629, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 131 (2022). Evidence of refusal, to show defendant believed he might fail, violates constitution.  Evidence of a refusal to submit to field sobriety tests, when used by the finder of fact as evidence that the accused refused to submit to the test because he bel ieved he might fail, violates the accuseds right, under Article I, § 8 of the Constitution of Virginia, not to be compelled. . .to give evidence against himself. Farmer v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 175, 390 S.E.2d 775, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1958, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 60 (1990). Defendant who refused to give proper breath sample was not entitled to dismissal based on lack of breath analysis.  Sufficient evidence supported the trial courts finding that defendant deliberately refused to cooperate in giving a breath sample where defendant, who had two prior DUI convictions, barely blew into the breathalyzer machine during a first attempt, resulting in the apparatus not being activated, and failed a second time to blow as instructed after the arresting officer informed defendant that defendant was not performing the test properly and gave defendant another chance; defendant did not give a medical reason for not giving a valid breath sample and it was reasonable for the officer to conclude from defendants conduct during the two attempts that defen dant was not cooperating and that defendant would continue such non-cooperation if further tests were attempted. Lee Banks Walker v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 246 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 22, 2003). Failure to offer test does not result in constitutional prejudice.  A defendant may not claim that he or she was constitutionally prejudiced by not having a preliminary breath test administered in that he or she was denied evidenc e that may have tended to corroborate the defendants testimony contesting the breathalyzer result; this section expressly provides that the results of such a test are not admissible in any prosecution but are intended instead to resolve disputes at t he scene regarding probable cause to arrest. Jones v. Town of Marion, 28 Va. App. 791, 508 S.E.2d 921, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 15 (1999), aff'd, 259 Va. 7, 524 S.E.2d 866, 2000 Va. LEXIS 15 (2000). The purpose of this section is to permit a preliminary analysis of the alcohol content o f the blood of a person suspected of driving while intoxicated and to authorize the officer to charge an accused who tests positive, but not to allow the test results to be admitted as evidence of guilt. Stacy v. Commonwealth, 22 Va. App. 417, 470 S.E.2d 584, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 349 (1996).

Hilberath v. Com monwealth, No. 0351-92-4 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 8, 1994). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Refusal to submit to test when not legally under arrest.  Court found the driving under the influence (DUI) defendant was improperly charged with refusing to submit to a breath or blood test since the defendant was not l egally under arrest for DUI, as the defendants arrest was in violation of § 19.2-81; therefore, when the defendant was read his implied consent rights, requiring him to have been lawfully arrested in order to be subject to the mandate to submit, t he defendants refusal to submit did not constitute a violation of the statute, and his refusal to submit was not admissible since the test itself, even if he had consented to the test, was inadmissible.

Any person, whether licensed by Virginia or not, who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway, as defined in § 46.2-100, in the Commonwealth shall be deemed thereby, as a condition of such operation, to have consented to have samples of his blood, breath, or both blood and breath taken for a chemical test to determine the alcohol, drug, or both alcohol and drug content of his blood, if he is arrested for violation of § 18.2-266, 18.2-266.1, or subsection B of § 18.2-272 or of a similar ordinance within thr ee hours of the alleged offense. B. Any person so arrested for a violation of clause (i) or (ii) of § 18.2-266 or both, § 18.2-266.1 or subsection B of § 18.2-272 or of a similar ordinance shall submit to a breath test. If the breath test is unavailable or the person is physically unable to submit to the breath test, a blood test shall be given. The accused shall, prior to administration of the test, be advised by the person administering the test that he has the right to observe the process of analysis and to see the blood-alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test. If the equipment automatically produces a written printout of the breath test result, the printout, or a copy, shall be given to the accused. C. A person, a fter having been arrested for a violation of clause (iii), (iv), or (v) of § 18.2-266 or § 18.2-266.1 or subsection B of § 18.2-272 or of a similar ordinance, may be required to submit to a blood test to determine the drug or both drug and alcoh ol content of his blood. When a person, after having been arrested for a violation of § 18.2-266 (i) or (ii) or both, submits to a breath test in accordance with subsection B or refuses to take or is incapable of taking such a breath test, he may be r equired to submit to tests to determine the drug or both drug and alcohol content of his blood if the law-enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe the person was driving under the influence of any drug or combination of drugs, or the combined influence of alcohol and drugs.

In any pros ecution for a violation of § 18.2-36.1 or clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of § 18.2-266 or any similar ordinance, the amount of alcohol or drugs in the blood of the accused at the time of the alleged offense as indicated by a chemical analysis of a sam ple of the accuseds blood or breath to determine the alcohol or drug content of his blood (i) in accordance with the provisions of §§ 18.2-268.1 through 18.2-268.12 or (ii) performed by the Department of Forensic Science in accordance with the provisions of §§ 18.2-268.5, 18.2-268.6, and 18.2-268.7 on the suspects whole blood drawn pursuant to a search warrant shall give rise to the following rebuttable presumptions: 1.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Consideration by the jury of the statutory presumptions created by this section does not deprive the defendant of any protected right. Kay v. United States, 255 F .2d 476, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 4221 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 825, 79 S. Ct. 42, 3 L. Ed. 2d 65, 1958 U.S. LEXIS 449 (1958). This section did not create a mandatory presumption, but allowed a permissive inference that the fact finder was free to reject; § 18.2-269 simply shifted the burden of producing evidence, while the burden of proof remained with the Commonwealth. The trial court analyzed the statute as a permissive inference, noting that it must be read to contain permissive inferences in order to satisfy due process requireme nts. Yap v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 622, 643 S.E.2d 523, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 171 (2007). Trial court did not err in refusing to declare §§ 18.2-269 and 18.2-270 unconstitutional in a case where defendant was charged with and later convicted of d riving under the influence of alcohol; there did not exist an evidentiary presumption relieving the Commonwealth of the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in those two statutes, as § 18.2-269 did not have a mandatory presumption but a rebuttabl e presumption and § 18.2-270 had no presumption at all. Lawrence v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 150 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 10, 2007). Defendants challenge to the constitutionality of the rebuttable presumptions employed by § 18.2-269 failed because the jury was not instructed on t hem and the presumptions clearly did not apply to the per se violations defendant claimed to have been convicted under. Morin v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 346 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 18, 2007). Pr esumptions inapplicable where defendant refuses tests.  The presumptions established by this section apply only when a blood or breath test is administered; this section does not apply where the defendant refused to ta ke either a blood or breath test and no test was given under the implied consent law. Groggins v. Commonwealth, 34 Va. App. 19, 537 S.E.2d 605, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 764 (2000). Evidence of results of hospital test of blood alcohol content, competent because support ed by a proper foundation, constituted other relevant evidence within the intendment of former § 18.2-268 (now § 18.2-268.1 et seq.) and was properly admitted as proof of drunken driving. However, this evidence, though probative, raised no legal presumption of intoxication, where it was not conducted in accordance with the provisions of former § 18.2-268. Essex v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 273, 322 S.E.2d 216, 1984 Va. LEXIS 200 (1984). Expert testimony.  Trial court did not err in allowing blood alcohol test results into evidence, where exigent circumstances justified warrantless arrest and search of defendant, an d Commonwealth relied on expert opinion to explain significance of defendants blood alcohol level and did not rely on statutory presumption contained in this section. Felts v. Commonwealth, No. 1997-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 5, 1999). Trial court did not err when it found that a police officer substantially complied with the requirements of § 18.2-268.9 when she administered a breath test to defendant who was coughing, and that expert testimony that defendant offered did not rebut the presumption created by § 18.2-269 that defendant was under the influence of alcohol, and the appellate court affirmed the trial courts judgment admitti ng the results of the test and using them to convict defendant of driving under the influence of alcohol. Wing v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 368 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 3, 2004). Evidence was sufficient to show that defendant was under the influence of alcohol where she had five or six alcohol beverages about five hours before the accident , a witness saw defendants vehicle swerve just before she hit the victim, the officers smelled alcohol on defendant after the accident, she failed two field sobriety tests, and an expert testified that her BAC at the time of the accident was between 0.10 and 0.13. Auman v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 347 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 21, 2014). Presumption that accused under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  Evidence was sufficient to establish that defendants blood alcohol level was 0.08 percent at the time when defendant was driving because, even if the Commonwe alth of Virginia could not pinpoint defendants precise blood alcohol content at the time, the jury could have concluded that defendants actual blood alcohol content at the time when defendant was driving would have been higher than the 0.08 perce nt level at which defendant tested several hours later. Harris v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 108 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 25, 2014). Defendant produced no evidence related to the timing of his alcohol consumption and intoxication, and therefore, the trial court was permitted to infer that he wa s under the influence of alcohol at the time he was driving; the appellate court could not conclude that no reasonable fact-finder, upon consideration of all the evidence, could have rejected defendants hypothesis that defendant was not intoxicated w hile he was driving. Nunez v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 250 (Va. Ct. App. June 21, 2022). Conviction under Va. Code Ann. § 18.2-266(iii) cannot rely on observations of a defendants behavior without other evidence linking that behavior to the eff ects of a particular drug to a degree that impairs his ability to drive safely; § 18.2-266(i) and (v) provide per se thresholds for conviction based upon enumerated levels of alcohol or drugs in a defendants blood and Va. Code Ann. § 18.2-269 c reates certain presumptions of a persons impairment to an unsafe degree based on different levels of alcohol or drugs. Brown v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 635 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 13, 2022). North Carolina statute not substantially similar to this section.  Under subdivision A (3) of this section, an accused may present evidence to rebut the presumption, and if suc...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-270"><akn:num>§ 18.2-270</akn:num><akn:heading>Penalty for driving while intoxicated; subsequent offense; prior conviction</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

In addition, such person shall be fined a mandatory minimum fine of $500. C. 1. Any person convicted of three offenses of § 18.2-266 committed within a 10-year p eriod shall upon conviction of the third offense be guilty of a Class 6 felony. The sentence of any person convicted of three offenses of § 18.2-266 committed within a 10-year period shall include a mandatory minimum sentence of 90 days, unless the th ree offenses were committed within a five-year period, in which case the sentence shall include a mandatory minimum sentence of confinement for six months. In addition, such person shall be fined a mandatory minimum fine of $1,000. 2. A person who has been convicted of § 18.2-36.1, 18.2-36.2, 18.2-51.4, 18.2-51.5, or a felony violation of § 18.2-266 shall upon conviction of a subsequent violation of § 18.2- 266 be guilty of a Class 6 felony.

CASE NOTES Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to deprive the convicted person of the right to secure a permit to operate a vehicle for a specified time after he has been convict ed once or more than once. Commonwealth v. Ellett, 174 Va. 403, 4 S.E.2d 762, 1939 Va. LEXIS 160 (1939). The purpose of §§ 18.2-266 and 18.2-270 through 18.2-273 is not only to punish drunken drivers, but to prevent such drivers from using the highways to the h azard of other citizens. Commonwealth v. Ellett, 174 Va. 403, 4 S.E.2d 762, 1939 Va. LEXIS 160 (1939). Provisions self-executing.  The provisions of this section become effective only after judgments of conviction, and then are self-executing. Commonwealth v. Ellett, 174 Va. 403, 4 S.E.2d 762 , 1939 Va. LEXIS 160 (1939). Procedure after orde ring suspension of license.  While a court suspends a drivers license under the provisions of § 18.2-271, the court must follow the procedure mandated in § 46.2-398 after ordering t he suspension of the license. Corbin v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 196, 604 S.E.2d 111, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 516 (2004). The loss of the right to operate a vehicle is no part of the judgment of conviction, or the punishment fixed by the court or jury, and no action or order of the court or other officer is required to put it into effect. It is not dependent upon evidence necessary to convict. Evidence of conviction alone is essential. Commonwealth v. Ellett, 174 Va. 403, 4 S.E.2d 762, 1939 Va. LEXIS 160 (1939).

I, § 8, and Rule 3A:13(a) guaranteed defendant a right to a jury in the trial court on both charges of driving under the influence and dr iving on a revoked operators license. McCormick v. City of Va. Beach, 5 Va. App. 369, 363 S.E.2d 124, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1452, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 249 (1987). Effect on driving privileges.  Defendant asserted that the governments evidence constructively amended the indictment resulting in a fatal variance; however, defendants contention that because he received a restricted license, his license was no longer suspended, lacked merit. Even though the license was restricted, he was suspended with the restrictions and the governments evidence that defendant had a restricted license did not a mount to a fatal variance from the offense charged in the indictment. United States v. Arias, 213 Fed. Appx. 230, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 711 (4th Cir. 2007). Driver was ineligible for a drivers license due to the similarity of the drivers convictions in other states to Virginia statutes prohibiting driving whil e intoxicated and after forfeiture of a license because (1) a dissimilar Georgia punishment did not make that states statute dissimilar for such purposes, and (2) a Florida release letter did not show the driver had no predicate Florida conviction an d suspension, as the letter did not mention a Tennessee conviction and subsequent Florida revocation, and the letter was sent in error as one of the drivers two National Driver Registry profiles listed the driver as ineligible. Dorman v. Commonwealth , 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 209 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 24, 2019). Arrest beyond the suspension period.  Defendant was improperly convicted under § 18.2-272 because the period of suspension authorized by § 18.2-271 was for one year from the date of defendant s conviction for driving while intoxicated and defendants arrest years later was well beyond the expiration of the suspension period imposed by § 18.2-271. Croft v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 205 (Va. Ct. App. June 30, 2015). Sufficiency of evidence.  Defendants statement that he did not have a drivers license, coupled with his presence at his previous trials for driving on a suspended license, bolstere d the Department of Motor Vehicles transcripts record of notice, on which there was a clear reference that notice of suspension or revocation was received; the finding that defendant had received notice was not plainly wrong, and his conviction f or driving during the time for which he was deprived of the right to do so, third or subsequent offense was affirmed. Peters v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. App. 743, 791 S.E.2d 764, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 304 (2016).

CASE NOTES Offense is a general intent offense.  The offense as defined by the statute is not a specific intent crime; rather, it is a general intent offense. Fleming v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 349, 412 S.E.2d 180, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1497, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 309 (1991). A violation of the statute may be established upon proof that a person unlawfully discharged a firearm at or in the direction of an occupied dwelling if the perso n knew or should have known that the dwelling was in the line of fire, even if the person did not specifically intend to shoot at or into the dwelling. Fleming v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 349, 412 S.E.2d 180, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1497, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 309 (1991). All that is required of the Commonwealth to prove a violation of this section is that it prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the principal in the first degree in tended to shoot at or toward an occupied dwelling. Fleming v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 349, 412 S.E.2d 180, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1497, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 309 (1991). Prosecution, to support a conviction for the lesser included offense of unlawfully discharging a firearm at or against an occupied building, in violation of § 18.2-279, was not required to prove that defendant had the specific intent to fire at or against a convenience store that was behind the person at whom defendant was shooting. Ellis v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 499, 706 S.E.2d 849, 2011 Va. LEXIS 46 (2011). Comm onwealth relieved of burden of proving endangerment.  The language of this statute is a legislative declaration that human lives may be endangered when a deadly weapon is maliciously discharged at or against a buildi ng occupied by people and that such conduct is felonious. This legislative determination relieves the Commonwealth of the burden of proving that human life was, in fact, endangered. Dowdy v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 114, 255 S.E.2d 506, 1979 Va. LEXIS 242 ( 1979). At or toward occupied dwelling.  In construing the plain meaning of the second prong of § 18.2-279, regarding maliciously shooting at a dwelling house, the word at had a common and eas ily understood meaning and was defined as a function word used to indicate that toward which an action is directed, so all that was required of the Commonwealth to prove a violation of § 18.2-279 was that it prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the pr incipal in the first degree intended to shoot at or toward an occupied dwelling. King v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 193, 578 S.E.2d 803, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 61 (2003). Defendant failed to prove a Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 ends-of-justice exception for unpreserved error because evidence was sufficient to show he unlawfully discharged a firearm with an occupied building in his line of fire, so his conduct was a criminal offense and each element of the offense occurred. Baublitz v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 445 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 20, 2022). No limitation on locale of shots.  Section 18.2-279, prohibiting the discharge of a firearm within or at an occupied dwelling, did not specify where the shooter had to be located in relation to the occupied dwelling, and there was no legislative directive implicating such a limitation, thus, when read together, the first prong of the statute dealt with the locale of the shot, (i.e., within the building), and the second prong concerned the destination of the shot, (i.e., at the building) and did not specify the locale of the shooter. King v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 193, 578 S.E.2d 803, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 61 (2003). Unit of prosecution.  Unit of prosecution under this section is each separate act of shooting. Thus, where the evidence established that defendant fired multiple shots into two separat e rooms at a motel and the occupants of both rooms were both put in peril by defendants actions, defendant committed two offenses of shooting at an occupied building. Tate v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 16, 2019). No mens rea required.  Court of Appeals properly affirmed defendants conviction for discharging a firearm within an occupied building because her proposed additional jury instructio n placing the burden upon the Commonwealth to prove that the discharge of the firearm was not accidental was properly refused as an incorrect statement of the law inasmuch as the General Assembly determined that such conduct was unlawful even if done acc identally or unintentionally. Bryant v. Commonwealth, 295 Va. 302, 811 S.E.2d 250, 2018 Va. LEXIS 32 (2018). Failure to instruct on essenti al elements.  In prosecution under this section, it was reversible error on the part of the trial court to fail to instruct the jury on the essential elements of the offense. D owdy v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 114, 255 S.E.2d 506, 1979 Va. LEXIS 242 (1979). Evidence of shooti ng similar to shooting charged.  While acquittal of a charge of a similar crime on the same night may lessen its probative value, it does not make it inadmissible and evidence of a shooting simil ar to shooting defendant was charged with had probative value. Tomlinson v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 218, 380 S.E.2d 26, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2596, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 62 (1989). The throwing of a bottle from close range with sufficient force to break the storm door and to injure homeowner is sufficient to support a finding that lives were put in peril within the meaning of this section. Waller v. Commonwealth, No. 1696-89-3 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 20, 1990). No probable cause to enter w ithout a warrant.  When police received a call that someone had been shooting a weapon on a certain street, and, when they contacted the person who made the call, that person pointe d out defendant, who was not engaged in any criminal behavior, they did not have probable cause allowing them to enter defendants back yard without a warrant, because the call did not state or reasonably imply that a weapon had been fired within  or at an occupied dwelling, so a person of reasonable caution was not warranted in believing that an offense had been or was being committed. Quente v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 212 (Va. Ct. App. May 4, 2004). Evidence sufficient to s how lives endangered.  Evidence that defendant shot a gun into the ceiling of a hospital while in close proximity to seventy-five persons and that there was a possibility that the bulle t might have ricocheted, was sufficient to prove the firearm was discharged in such a manner as to endanger lives. Strickland v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 180, 428 S.E.2d 507, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1106, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 74 (1993). Evidence was sufficient to establish that the defendant discharged a firearm in a manner that endangered the lives of those in a store, notwithstanding that the s hells which he fired from a shotgun had no pellets or other shot, where a detective testified that the weapon discharged a wad that would enter a person standing nearby just like a bullet. Browder v. Commonwealth, No. 1499-97-2 (Ct. of Appeals De c. 22, 1998). Evidence that defendant fired weapon inside house showed that defendant endangered spouses life, as defendant fired the weapon in the bedroom and the spouse w as sitting in the nearby living room, close enough to be endangered had the ammunition deflected. Kirby v. Commonwealth, 264 Va. 440, 570 S.E.2d 832, 2002 Va. LEXIS 164 (2002). Evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the offense of shooting into an occupied dwelling in violation of § 18.2-27 9, where: (1) in addition to blood evidence, primer residue from a gunshot was found on defendants hand; (2) defendants own written statement placed him at the scene; (3) a letter from defendant was intercepted, which indicated that a witness had seen defendant on the back porch during the shooting, and suggested testimony to explain the events; and (4) although the shootings might not have been part of the original plan, since defendant participated in the planned enterprise, he could be held a ccountable for the incidental crimes. Paxton v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 785 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 31, 2002). When defendant was indicted for shooting at or against an occupied building or dwelling house, putting the lives of the occupa...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-280"><akn:num>§ 18.2-280</akn:num><akn:heading>Willfully discharging firearms in public places</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. If any pers on willfully discharges or causes to be discharged any firearm in any street in a city or town, or in any place of public business or place of public gathering, and such conduct results in bodily injury to another person, he shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. If such conduct does not result in bodily injury to another person, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. B. If any pers on willfully discharges or causes to be discharged any firearm upon the buildings and grounds of any public, private or religious elementary, middle or high school, he shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony, unless he is engaged in a program or curriculum s ponsored by or conducted with permission of a public, private or religious school.

D. This sectio n shall not apply to any law-enforcement officer in the performance of his official duties nor to any other person whose said willful act is otherwise justifiable or excusable at law in the protection of his life or property, or is otherwise specifically authorized by law.

Acts 2001, c. 712, cl. 2, provides: That the provisions of this act may result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment in state correctional facilities. Pursuant to § 30-19.1:4, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined. The 1999 amendment inserted and such conduct results in bodily injury to another person, he shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. If such conduct does not result in bodily injury to another person in subsection A; and added subsection D. The 2001 amendments. The 2001 amendment by c. 712, in subsection B, inserted the buildings and grounds of, deleted including the buildings and grounds or upon public prope rty within 1,000 feet of such school property following high school, and inserted unless he is engaged in a program or curriculum sponsored by or conducted with permission of a public, private or parochial school at the end; added pre sent subsection C, and redesignated former subsections C and D as present subsections D and E; and deleted the last sentence of present subsection D, which formerly read: In addition, subsection B shall not apply to any otherwise lawful discharge wh ile actually engaged in lawful hunting, a program or curriculum sponsored by or conducted with permission of the school or while in or on an established shooting range. The 2005 amendments.

Rev. 741 (2001). For annual survey article, Criminal Law and Procedure, see 44 U. Rich. L. Rev. 339 (2009). CASE NOTES Construction.  Subsection A of § 18.2-280, unlike § 18.2-282, the gravamen of 18.2-280 is not narrowly limited to the effect of the discharge on an observer, but rather, i t also includes the physical danger the discharge of a firearm in such a place would pose to the general public; it is axiomatic that an object with the mere appearance of a firearm cannot be discharged, and including such objects in the definition would impermissibly expand the statute. Gerald v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 167, 805 S.E.2d 407, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 261 (2017). Sections 18.2-280 and 18.2-282 are contained in Article 4 of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2 of the Code entitled Dangerous Use Of Firearms and Other Weapons, the definition of firearm in Subsection C of § 18.2-282 serves the intended purpose of § 18.2-280, and this definition also serves the interest of giving consistent meaning to the language used by the General Assembly in similar statutes; ther efore the definition of firearm in Subsection C of § 18.2-282 is the appropriate definition of firearm for § 18.2-280. Gerald v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 167, 805 S.E.2d 407, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 261 (2017). Definition of sc hool property in subsection C.  Evidence that defendant discharged a firearm within 1,000 feet of the property line of school property was sufficient to support defendants conviction under subsection C of this section, because there was nothing in subsection C that distinguished between schools that lease facilities and those that did not, or limited its application to schools that were in session or occupied. King v. Commonwealth, 53 Va. App. 257, 670 S.E.2d 767, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 1 (2009). Public property.  Proof that a defendant fired a firearm from property owned by the government is required under subsection C of § 18.2-280. Cuffee v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 353, 735 S.E.2d 693, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 7 (2013). Testimony that defendant shot from the rear of a vehicle parked on a street supported the trial courts conclusion that defendant shot from the street, which w as public property; therefore, defendants conviction under subsection C of § 18.2-280 was proper. Cuffee v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 353, 735 S.E.2d 693, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 7 (2013). Relationship with other law.  District court did not clearly err in enhancing defendants sentence on the ground that he possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense; the testimonial and forensic evidence supported the finding that defendant fired the series of shots outside a nightclub, wounding a witness, which constituted a felony under Virginia law. United States v. Wallace, 480 Fed. Appx. 739, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 1 0423 (4th Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 952, 133 S. Ct. 452, 184 L. Ed. 2d 277, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 7834 (2012), dismissed, No. 4:12cv170, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49211 (E.D. Va. Apr. 4, 2013). Plain language of § 18.2-280, as supported by later acts of Virginias legislature and by decisions of its appellate courts, prohibited conduct involving th e use of any firearm, including antique firearms, and thus petitioner was not required to identify a prosecution under the Virginia statute involving an antique firearm to defend against removal. Because the conduct punishable under § 18.2-280 was broader than the conduct encompassed by the federal definition of a firearm offense that applied to the INA removal statute, petitioners conviction under the Virginia statute was not a basis for his removal. Gordon v. Barr, 965 F.3d 252, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 21188 (4th Cir. 2020). Election of which offense to prosecu te.  Trial court erred in convicting defendant of both use of a firearm in the commission of a felony and discharge of a firearm in a public place because, while the j ury was properly instructed and the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant, the trial court erred in not requiring the Commonwealth to elect which offense it would prosecute where the second statute gave the Commonwealth a choice as to which offens e to prosecute. Green v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 36 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 13, 2018). Sufficient evidence.  Evidence was sufficient to support defendants convictions for discharging a firearm in public, brandishing a firearm, and possession of a firearm by a convict ed felon because he discharged a firearm multiple times in a public place; there was no need to determine make, model, and caliber when the law required a weapon designed to expel single or multiple projectiles, and defendant showed that capability in fr ont of multiple witnesses, one of whom was an experienced law-enforcement officer. Gerald v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 167, 805 S.E.2d 407, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 261 (2017). Evidence was sufficient to support defendants firearms convictions because a rational fact-finder could have found that defendant fired the gun and subsequent ly dropped it on the grass ten feet away from where he fired it, and that the lives and limbs of the people who were nearby partying outdoors were endangered when defendant discharged the bullet into the air.

It shall be unlawful for any person to point, hold or brandish any firearm or any air or gas operated weapon or any object similar in appearance, whether capable of being fired or not, in such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another or hold a fir earm or any air or gas operated weapon in a public place in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another of being shot or injured. However, this section shall not apply to any person engaged in excusable or justifiable self-defense. Persons violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor or, if the violation occurs upon any public, private or religious elementary, middle or high school, including buildings and grounds or upon public property within 1,000 feet of such school property, he shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. B. Any police officer in the performance of his duty, in making an arrest under the provisions of this section, shall not be civilly liable in damages for injuries or death resulting to the person being arrested if he had reason to believe that the person being arrest ed was pointing, holding, or brandishing such firearm or air or gas operated weapon, or object that was similar in appearance, with intent to induce fear in the mind of another. C. For purpose s of this section, the word firearm means any weapon that will or is designed to or may readily b e converted to expel single or multiple projectiles by the action of an explosion of a combustible material. The word ammunition, as used herein, shall mean a cartridge, pellet, ball, missile or projectile adapted for use in a firearm. History History.

The 2003 amendment by c. 976, in subsection A, substituted or any air or gas operated weapon for as hereinafter described following brandish a ny firearm, deleted to a firearm following appearance, and inserted or any air or gas operated weapon preceding in a public place; substituted or air or gas operated weapon, or object that was similar in appearance  for or object which was similar in appearance to a firearm in subsection B; and substituted means any weapon that will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel single or multiple projectiles by the action of an explosion of a combustible material for shall mean any weapon in which ammunition may be used or discharged by explosion or pneumatic pressure in subsection C.

CASE NOTES Elements of offense.  There are two elements of the offense: (1) pointing or brandishing a firearm; and (2) doing so in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of a vict im. Kelsoe v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 197, 308 S.E.2d 104, 1983 Va. LEXIS 306 (1983). Gravamen of offense is inducemen t of fear.  In this section, the General Assembly clearly proscribed an offense against the person. The gravamen of the offense is the inducement of fear in another. Kelsoe v . Commonwealth, 226 Va. 197, 308 S.E.2d 104, 1983 Va. LEXIS 306 (1983). Defining firearm.  Whether the term firearm when used in a statute without being defined is to be given its traditional meaning or a more expansive meaning depends upon the purpose and policy underlying the particular statute. When the statute is designed not only to deter physical harm, a more expansive definition of firearm is required in order to effectuate that purpose. On the other hand, when a statute is desig ned only to proscribe the act of possessing a firearm or the conduct of a felon in order to reduce a real threat of harm to the public, a narrower, more traditional definition of firearm is required. Jones v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 354, 429 S. E.2d 615, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1316, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 116 (1993), reinstated, 17 Va. App. 233, 436 S.E.2d 192, 10 Va. Law Rep. 408, 1993 Va.

Sections 18.2-280 and 18.2-282 are contained in Article 4 of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2 of the Code entitled Dangerous Use Of Firearms and Other Weapons, the definition of firearm in subsection C of § 18.2-282 serves the intended purpose of § 18.2-280, and this definition also serves the interest of giving consistent meaning to the language used by the General Assembly in similar statutes; ther efore the definition of firearm in subsection C of § 18.2-282 is the appropriate definition of firearm for § 18.2-280. Gerald v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 167, 805 S.E.2d 407, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 261 (2017). Where there is no evidence that fear by victim was intended or resulted, this section is not applicable. Bailey v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 331, 362 S.E.2d 750, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1409, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 245 (1987). Multiple punishment for pointing firearm at several people is not double jeopardy.  Where defendant pointed the pistol toward three men and each was afraid and backed away from the defendant, imposition of three punishments did not constitute dou ble jeopardy. Kelsoe v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 197, 308 S.E.2d 104, 1983 Va. LEXIS 306 (1983). Conviction for brandishing a firearm and assault did not violate double jeopardy.  Because defendants commission of an assault and the brandishing of a firearm were two distinct and separate acts, separated in time and space, and each convic tion was sustained by different evidence, his double jeopardy rights were not violated. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 251 (Va. Ct. App. May 27, 2008). Privilege to p rotect property is defense to section.  The trial judge erred in not permitting defendant, charged under this section, from asserting the defense of privilege to protect property from an armed trespasse r. Diffendal v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 417, 382 S.E.2d 24, 6 Va. Law Rep. 69, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 88 (1989). Brandishing shotgun disproportionate force where cable workers unarmed.  The brandishing of the shotgun by defendant was disproportionate to any threat posed by the unarmed cable workers, irrespective of the legality of the cable compa nys conduct. Pike v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 373, 482 S.E.2d 839, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 168 (1997). Inadvertent sighting insufficient.  The elements of this section are not proved beyond a reasonable doubt when the evidence merely proved that a person holding a firearm was inadvertently seen by an other. Thus, the evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant held the gun in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another. Crewe v. Commonwealth, No. 2709-95-2 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 29, 1996). Sufficient evidence of brandishing.  Where record disclosed that defendants sister excitedly called upon defendant to give her the gun, prompting him to rush toward the residence, armed w ith a .44 or .45 caliber pistol; a clicking sound was heard as defendant loaded a clip of ammunition into the weapon, and he yelled Ill F[ ] all you M[ ] F[ ]ers up.; defendant entered the home, waving the gun about and pointi ng it at people inside, and demanded, Who in the f[ ] hit my sister?; and four persons present during the offenses identified the weapon as a gray gun, with a long barrel; the jury properly concluded that the defendant possessed an actual firearm and brandished it at those present in the residence. Britt v. Commonwealth, No. 0679-96-1 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 15, 1997). Defendants conviction of brandishing a firearm was supported by sufficient evidence, as defendants act of showing the victim a flare gun in defendants waistband constituted brandishing, and the action induced fear in the victim. Morris v. Commonwealth, 269 Va. 127, 607 S.E.2d 110, 2005 Va. LEXIS 3 (2005). Evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant violated subsection A of § 18.2-282 as to the owner of a house because the owners request of defendant to p ut his gun away was sufficient evidence of the owners requisite apprehension of bodily harm; the owners apprehension was further confirmed by her testimony that defendant was only deterred from brandishing his gun by the threat of police interven tion. Huffman v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 469, 658 S.E.2d 713, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 165 (2008). Sufficient evidence supported defendants conviction for brandishing a firearm because the trial courts finding that he did not act in self-defense was not plainly wrong, as (1) neither victim displayed or threatened to use a firearm or other weapon on the date of the crime, (2) a statement of facts indicated the victims were not armed, (3) there was no evidence that the victims shouts at defendant evi denced an intent to inflict bodily harm on defendant, (4) while defendant fled when the victims arrived at the crimes location, the fact-finder could conclude that defendant did not prove defendant reasonably apprehended a danger to defendant, (5) wh ile a victim had held defendant at gunpoint two years earlier, which would have supported a finding that defendant could reasonably have feared for defendants safety when the victims confronted defendant at the time of the crime, the trier of fact co uld conclude defendant did not prove defendant harbored such fear on that date. Swilling v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 169 (Va. Ct. App. May 17, 2011). Evidence supported defendants conviction for brandishing a firearm because he pointed an object at multiple individuals in a manner intended to induce fear ba sed upon its appearance as a weapon capable of firing one or more times, a...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-283"><akn:num>§ 18.2-283</akn:num><akn:heading>Carrying dangerous weapon to place of religious worship</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If any person carry any gun, pistol, bowie knife, dagger or other dangerous weapon, without good and sufficient reason, to a place of worship while a meeting for religi ous purposes is being held at such place he shall be guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor.

CASE NOTES Defining firearm.  Whether the term firearm when used in a statute without being defined is to be given its traditional meaning or a more expansive meaning depends upon the purpose and policy underlying the particular statute. When the statute is designed not only to deter physical harm, a more expansive definition of firearm is required in order to effectuate that purpose. On the other hand, when a statute is desig ned only to proscribe the act of possessing a firearm or the conduct of a felon in order to reduce a real threat of harm to the public, a narrower, more traditional definition of firearm is required.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Forfeiture of weapons.  With very rare possible exceptions, subsection A of § 29.1-521.2 establishes the procedure to be used in forfeiting a firearm used by a person convicted of vio lating this section. The court convicting the violator has the discretion to declare a forfeiture of the firearm used in the crime. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Phillip C. Steele, Commonwealths Attorney for Giles County, 05-047 (8 /19/05). The Commonwealths attorney of the county or city wherein the forfeiture of a firearm was incurred must file an information to enforce that forfeiture in the c ircuit court of his county or city. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Phillip C. Steele, Commonwealths Attorney for Giles County, 05-047 (8/19/05). § 18.2-286.1. Shooting from vehicles so as to endanger persons; penalty. Text Any person who, while in or on a motor vehicle, intentionally discharges a firearm so as to create the risk of injury or death to another person or thereby cause anothe r person to have a reasonable apprehension of injury or death shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. Nothing in this section shall apply to a law-enforcement officer in the performance of his duties. History History. 1990, c. 951. Annotations Cross references.

CASE NOTES Construction.  Interpreting § 18.2-154 to include firing shots while seated in a vehicle did not render § 18.2-286.1, barring firing shots while seated in a motor vehicle, superfluous because (1) the existence of a similar but not identical statutes did not alter a courts duty to construe a statute according to the statutes plain language, (2) the statutes were textually and conceptually different, despite some ov erlap between the conduct the statutes barred, and the fact that separate statutes overlapped in the statutes proscription of specific conduct did not detract from the statutes independent enforcement except when double jeopardy concerns were imp licated. Jones v. Commonwealth, 296 Va. 412, 821 S.E.2d 540, 2018 Va. LEXIS 174 (2018). Multiple shots const itute multiple violations.  This statute does not proscribe a continuous course of conduct; rather, each offense is complete upon the firing of one shot when the life of another is endangere d and a defendant who fires multiple shots from one motor vehicle may thus be convicted of multiple violations of the statute. Stephens v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 141, 543 S.E.2d 609, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 134 (2001), aff'd, 263 Va. 58, 557 S.E.2d 227, 2 002 Va. LEXIS 6 (2002). Lack of jurisdiction.  In a case in which defendant appealed his conviction for violating §§ 18.2-51, 18.2-53.1, and 18.2-286.1, he argued that evidence of other crimes was inadmi ssible. The appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider his argument as it was not presented in the assignment of error on his brief, as required by Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12(c)(1), and was not included as part of the assignment of error on which the app eal was granted at the petition stage. Wyche v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 227 (Va. Ct. App. July 10, 2012). Evidence held sufficient. Sufficient evidence supported defendants conviction for malicious wounding, use of a firearm in the commission of malicious wounding, maliciously shooting int o an occupied vehicle, and shooting from a vehicle because the evidence showed he was shooting a gun from the front passenger seat of the car. When a police officer stopped the car and searched the vehicle in which defendant was riding, he found two .40 caliber, semi-automatic firearms with loaded magazines hidden under the carpet in the floor of the front passenger seat, where defendant had been sitting. Slayton v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 84 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 29, 2022). Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendants conviction for discharging a firearm while in a vehicle where surveillance video and a detectives testimony established muzzle flashes outside the front-passenger and right-rear-passenger windows, and defendant was sitting in the right-rear seat, his window still rolled down, when the vehicle was stopped a few seconds later. Moreover, the hypothesis that the v ehicles driver or the left-rear passenger fired shots through defendants window was sufficiently negated by the surveillance video showing muzzle flashes outside the right rear window, the lack of shell casings inside the vehicle, and defendant s statements. Wyche-Alexander v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 149 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2023). Evidence insufficient.  The evidence was held insufficient to sustain the convictions under this statute.

Weapons, § 4.1. CASE NOTES Defining firearm.  Whether the term firearm when used in a statute without being defined is to be given its traditional meaning or a more expansive meaning depends upon the purpose and policy underlying the particular statute. When the statute is designed not only to deter physical harm, a more expansive definition of firearm is required in order to effectuate that purpose. On the other hand, when a statute is desig ned only to proscribe the act of possessing a firearm or the conduct of a felon in order to reduce a real threat of harm to the public, a narrower, more traditional definition of firearm is required.

CASE NOTES Commonwealth must prove defendant used sawed-off shotgun in commission of crime.  Trial judge committed reversible error by giving an instruction to the jury which read: Under the law, the weapon in this case was a sawed-off shotgun si nce the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used a sawed-off shotgun in the commission of the crime of murder or manslaughter.

Jury must deci de whether gun is a sawed-off shotgun.  Whether the weapon met the statutory definition of a sawed-off shotgun was a factual issue for the jury to decide. Bruce v. Commonwealth, 9 Va. App. 298, 387 S.E.2d 279, 6 Va. Law Rep. 909, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 1 (1990). Jury properly used their reason, common sense, knowledge, experience, and examination of the gun at issue to determine whether it met the statutory definition of sawed-off shotgun under § 18.2-299 because the gun was admitted into evidence and the trial court properly instructed the jury on the definition. Person v. Commonwealth, 60 Va. App. 549, 729 S.E.2d 782, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2012). Evidence was sufficient to prove that sawed-off shotgun was used in commission of offense.  Evidence proved that appellant was one of two men who chased victim and fired upon him with the intent to kill, and while appellant and his coconspirators actuall y intended to kill the victims son, appellant mistakenly believed that the victim was in fact his son during the pursuit, and accordingly, when the two men fired upon the victim with the intent to kill his son, their murderous intent was transferred to the killing of the victim, and evidence supported the conclusion that the sawed-off shotgun was used in the commission of this offense for the victim testified that he observed appellant cocking something as appellant exited car and began to r un towards him.

Effect of absence of firing pin.  Possession of a weapon that would have become a completely operable sawed-off shotgun after a moments delay to insert a firing pin satisfies the statutory def inition of sawed-off shotgun. The absence of a firing pin in such a weapon does not exempt it from prohibition. Rogers v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 774, 418 S.E.2d 727, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3605, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 175 (1992). The absence of a firing pin in a weapon does not exempt it from the definition of any weapon . . . from which a number of ball shot pellets or projectiles may be fired as provided in the definition of sawed-off shotgun. Robinson v. Commonwealth, No. 0934-91-2 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 6, 1992). Caliber requirement is a n element of the crime.  In prosecutions for possession of a sawed-off shotgun, the Commonwealth must prove that the subject weapon falls within the statutory definition, including the re quirement that it be not less than a specified caliber; the statutory requirement relating to the weapons caliber defines an element of the crime and not an affirmative defense. Dillard v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 340, 504 S.E.2d 411, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 501 (1998). Evidence sufficient for conviction.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the firearm found in defendants vehicle met the statutory definition of a sawed-off shotgun as a photograph of the firearm found in defendants car and the actual firearm were submitted into evidence; the evidence showed that the butt of the firearm had been cut and modified from a shoulder-fired weapon to a pistol gr ip; and the barrel had been shorted and was 14.75 inches in length.

CASE NOTES Actual knowledge of the weapons specific physical characteristics is not required. R ather, sufficient intent is established if the defendant is shown to have possessed an item which he knew to be a firearm within the general meaning of the term.

Commonwealth, No. 1089-87-3 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 25, 1989).

Caliber requirement is a n element of the crime.  In prosecutions for possession of a sawed-off shotgun, the Commonwealth must prove that the subject weapon falls within the statutory definition, including the re quirement that it be not less than a specified caliber; the statutory requirement relating to the weapons caliber defines an element of the crime and not an affirmative defense. Dillard v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 340, 504 S.E.2d 411, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 501 (1998). Evidence sufficient for conviction.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the firearm found in defendants vehicle met the statutory definition of a sawed-off shotgun as a photograph of the firearm found in defendants car and the actual firearm were submitted into evidence; the evidence showed that the butt of the firearm had been cut and modified from a shoulder-fired weapon to a pistol gr ip; and the barrel had been shorted and was 14.75 inches in length.

Text Any person, firm, association or corporation who or which intentionally removes, defaces, alters, changes, destroys or obliterates in any manner or way or who or which causes to be removed, defaced, altered, changed, destroyed or obliterated in any manner or way the name of the maker, model, manufacturers or serial number, or any other mark or identification on any pistol, shotgun, rifle, machine gun or any other f irearm shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.

CASE NOTES Venue.  Defendants conviction of altering the serial number of a firearm in violation of § 18.2-311.1 was reversed; as there was no evidence he removed the serial number in Brunswick County, the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden under § 19.2-244 to show that venue was proper in that county. Bonner v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 247, 734 S.E.2d 692, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 399 (2012). As the offense of altering or removing a serial number of a firearm, § 18.2-311.1, constitutes a discrete act rather than a continuing offense, under § 19.2 -244, venue is proper where the alteration or removal was done. Bonner v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 247, 734 S.E.2d 692, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 399 (2012). Altering the serial number of a firearm is a discrete act so that venue for a prosecution under this statute lies in the county where the alteration occurred. Thu s a trial court erred in finding that the Commonwealth established a strong presumption that the alteration of the serial number in defendants possession occurred in Brunswick County as there was no testimony or other evidence that defendant was the one who filed down the serial number, let alone where that discrete act occurred. Bonner v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. App. 206, 745 S.E.2d 162, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 216 (2013). § 18.2-311.2. Third conviction of firearm offenses; penalty.

Bolton v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. App. 358, 550 S.E.2d 342, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 477 (2001). Caustic substance.  Classification of a substance as a caustic substance does not preclude a classification of the same substance as a noxious gas; a substance may have the c haracteristics of both a noxious gas and a caustic substance, and a noxious gas, for example, may cause bodily injury through its caustic, or burning, effects. Therefore, in a case where defendant either used mace or pepper spray, it was up to the prosec utor to determine what crime to charge her with. Somerville v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 45 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 10, 2015), aff'd, No. 150386, 2016 Va. Unpub. LEXIS 3 (Va. Feb. 12, 2016). Evidence sufficient.  Evidence was sufficient to support convictions for malicious use of a noxious gas to cause bodily injury and criminal solicitation of another to maliciously use a noxious gas to cause bodily injury where defendant sprayed a security officer in the face and encouraged her companion to do the same; testimony concerning the physical composition of pepper spray did not establish that the substance at issue was a liqu id, rather than a gas. While the substance might have technically consisted of liquid particles, they were combined with other molecules and released from a canister in a gaseous state through an aerosol spray.

Annotations CASE NOTES Construction.  Concealing a body under § 18.2-323.02 may occur without dishonoring or desecrating a corpse, the conduct addressed in subsection B of § 18.2-126; defendant attempted to prevent detection of the victims death by telling her family that she would return, even though he knew that she was dead and he had left her body in a city park, plus defendant told police that he last saw her when she left the house to buy drugs, but he did not admit that she had died in his bedroom that night. Everett v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 14, 2020). Definition of dead body.  In a case in which defendant entered a conditional guilty plea for concealing a dead body in violation of § 18.2-323.02, the appellate court disagreed with def endants contention the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss the charge at issue because a fetus that dies in the womb does not fall within the definition of dead body as contemplated by the statute. Because it is clear that a st illborn fetus can fall within the applicable statutory definition of a dead body, and because it is clear that the legislature intended to treat it as such, the trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to dismiss.

Unless the driver is delivering alcoholic beverages in accordance with the provisions of § 4.1-212.1, a rebuttable presumption that the driver has consumed an alcoholic beverage in violation of this section shall be created if (i) an open container is located wi thin the passenger area of the motor vehicle, (ii) the alcoholic beverage in the open container has been at least partially removed, and (iii) the appearance, conduct, odor of alcohol, speech, or other physical characteristic of the driver of the motor v ehicle may be reasonably associated with the consumption of an alcoholic beverage. C. For the pur poses of this section: Open container means any vessel containing an alcoholic beverage, except the originall y sealed manufacturers container. Passenger area means the area designed to seat the driver of any motor vehicle, any ar ea within the reach of the driver, including an unlocked glove compartment, and the area designed to seat passengers. Passenger area does not include the trunk of any passenger vehicle, the area behind the last upright seat of a passenger van, st ation wagon, hatchback, sport utility vehicle, or any similar vehicle, the living quarters of a motor home, or the passenger area of a motor vehicle designed, maintained, or used primarily for the transportation of persons for compensation, including a b us, taxi, or limousine, while engaged in the transportation of such persons.

CASE NOTES Rela tionship with offense of driving under the influence.  Where the presence of an open container of alcohol and defendants appearance gave rise to a rebuttable presumption that defendant consumed alcohol while drivi ng, the fact that an officer did not perceive defendant to be drunk or driving under the influence did not negate the presumption because a driver did not have to be intoxicated to the extent necessary to support a conviction under § 18.2-266 in order to be found guilty of drinking while operating a motor vehicle in violation of § 18.2-323.1.United States v. Washington, 439 F. Supp. 2d 589, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52064 (E.D. Va. 2006), aff'd, 338 Fed. Appx. 316, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 16364 (4th Cir. 2009). Open container and defendants appearance justified vehicle search.  Officer who observed a partially empty bottle of alcohol inside defendants vehicle during a traffic stop did not violate the Fourth Amendment by retrieving th e bottle because the presence of the open container of alcohol combined with the officers observation that defendants eyes were watery and bloodshot and that defendants hands were shaking gave rise to a rebuttable presumption that defendant c onsumed alcohol while driving. United States v. Washington, 439 F. Supp. 2d 589, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52064 (E.D. Va. 2006), aff'd, 338 Fed. Appx. 316, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 16364 (4th Cir. 2009). No probable cause to search.  Because an open container alone was not illegal under the statue, and there was no evidence defendant consumed alcohol while driving, officers did not have probab le cause to search the vehicle for contraband or evidence of a crime relating to alcohol consumption; assuming the open container contained alcohol that was partially removed, the Commonwealth did not establish the rebuttable presumption because they did not testify that defendants appearance or conduct evidenced alcohol consumption. Commonwealth v. Branch, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 245 (Va. Ct. App. June 21, 2022). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Open container and defendants appearance justified vehicle search.  An officer had probable cause under the Fourth Amendment to search defendants vehicle because there was a brown paper bag crunched around the neck of a bottle located at defendants feet, defendant ran a red light at night, appeared confused, smelled of alcohol, had glassy eyes, and slurred his speech. Commonwealth v. Tabron, 2023 Va. Cir. LEXIS 17 (Norfolk Feb. 16, 2023).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-324"><akn:num>§ 18.2-324</akn:num><akn:heading>Throwing or depositing certain substances upon highway; removal of such substances</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text No person shall throw or deposit or cause to be deposited upon any highway any glass bottle, glass, nail, tack, wire, can, or any other substance likely to injure any p erson or animal, or damage any vehicle upon such highway, nor shall any person throw or deposit or cause to be deposited upon any highway any soil, sand, mud, gravel or other substances so as to create a hazard to the traveling public.

For the purposes of this subdivision and notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary, the making, placing, or receipt of any bet or wager of money or other consideration or thing of value shall include the purchase of a product, Internet access, or other thing made in exchange for a chance to win a prize, stake, or other consideration or thing of value by means of the operation of a gambling device as described in subdivision 3 b, regardless of whether the chance to win such prize, stake, or other consideration or thing of value may be offered in the absence of a purchase. Illegal gambling also means the playing or offering for play of any skill game. 2. Interstate gambling means the conduct of an enterprise for profit that engages in the purchase or sale within the Commonwealth of any interest in a lottery of another state or country whether or not such interest is an actual lottery ticket, receipt, contingent promise to pay, order to purchase, or other record of such interest. 3. Gambling device includes: a. Any device, machine, paraphernalia, equipment, or other thing, including books, records, and other papers, which are actually used in an illegal gambling operation or activity; b. Any machine, apparatus, implement, instrument, contrivance, board, or other thing, or electronic or video versions thereof, including but not limited to those dependent upon the i nsertion of a coin or other object for their operation, which operates, either completely automatically or with the aid of some physical act by the player or operator, in such a manner that, depending upon elements of chance, it may eject something of va lue or determine the prize or other thing of value to which the player is entitled, provided, however, that the return to the user of nothing more than additional chances or the right to use such machine is not deemed something of value within the meanin g of this subsection; and provided further, that machines that only sell, or entitle the user to, items of merchandise of equivalent value that may differ from each other in composition, size, shape, or color, shall not be deemed gambling devices within the meaning of this subsection; and c. Skill games. Such devices are no less gambling devices if they indicate beforehand the definite result of one or more operations but not all the operations. Nor are they any less a gambling device because, apart from their use or adaptability as such, they may also sell or deliver something of value on a basis other than chance. 4. Operator includes any person, firm, or association of persons, who conducts, finances, manages, superv ises, directs, or owns all or part of an illegal gambling enterprise, activity, or operation. 5. Skill means the knowledge, dexterity, or any other ability or expertise of a natural person. 6. Skill game means an electronic, computerized, or mechanical contrivance, terminal, machine, or other d evice that requires the insertion of a coin, currency, ticket, token, or similar object to operate, activate, or play a game, the outcome of which is determined by any element of skill of the player and that may deliver or entitle the person playing or o perating the device to receive cash or cash equivalents, gift cards, vouchers, billets, tickets, tokens, or electronic credits to be exchanged for cash or cash equivalents whether the payoff is made automatically from the device or manually. Skill ga me includes (i) a device that contains a meter or measurement device that records the number of free games or portions of games that are rewarded and (ii) a device designed or adapted to enable a person using the device to increase the chances of win ning free games or portions of games by paying more than the amount that is ordinarily required to play the game. Skill game does not include any amusement device, as defined in § 18.2-334.6. 7. Unregulated location means any location that is not regulated or operated by the Virginia Lottery or V irginia Lottery Board, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority, or the Virginia Racing Commission.

CASE NOTES Application.  There was sufficient proof that through his activities, defendant knowingly aided and abetted the illegal gambling among spectators of the cockfighting operation, and insomuch as § 18.2-326 made gambling on cockfighting illegal, and thus encompassed within 18 U.S.C.S. § 1955(b)(1), defendants statutory argument failed; although § 18.2-333 clarified that participants in a contest of skill, where they may win a prize or purse, were not guilty of gambling, nothing in that made it lawful for any person to wager on the outcome of such events. United States v. Kingrea, 567 F.3d 119, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 11505 (4th Cir.), sub. op., 573 F.3d 186, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 28956 (4th Cir. 2009). Malum prohibitum.  In this State gambling is mala prohibita. Parr v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 721, 96 S.E.2d 160, 1957 Va. LEXIS 130 (1957). Gambling is not an offense at common law. Parr v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 721, 96 S.E.2d 16 0, 1957 Va. LEXIS 130 (1957). It is unlawful to bet at any game at a public place. Neal v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. (22 Gra tt.) 917, 1872 Va. LEXIS 70 (1872). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL The element of consideration, etc. is missing, and therefore no illegal gambling occurs, when the opportunity to win a prize is offered both with a purchase and without the requirement of a purcha se. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Bill Janis, Member, House of Delegates, 10-064, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 41 (7/30/10). Whether scenarios involving charitable donations at computer terminals, political contributions made from computers in business establishments, or sale of prepaid , rechargeable telephone card and/or computer work station time constitute legal sweepstakes or illegal gambling, depends on whether the element of consideration is missing. The question is whether the sweepstakes is the product, i.e., individuals are pa ying to participate in a game of chance, or whether it is a charitable donation, political contribution or marketing tool. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable G. Manoli Loupassi, Member, House of Delegates, 11-086, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 58 (8/12 /11). Illegal gambling.  Hypothetical examples that center on payment of money in exchange for a product, such as a phone card or a DVD, where the product offered to the consumer is not i n fact the object of the transaction, instead, the consumer disregards the item purchased and seeks the opportunity to play a game of chance in order to win prizes or money, would constitute illegal gambling because the elements of prize, chance and consideration are present.

Gaming and Gaming Contracts, § 19; 12A M.J. Lotte ries, §§ 3, 4. CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Even if the definition of illegal gambling in § 18.2-325 was read as not having an exception for games of skill, § 18.2-333 provided that skill be c onsidered in determining whether § 18.2-328 had been violated. The ruling of the circuit court concerning § 18.2-325 could not have rendered an otherwise valid § 18.2-328 void for vagueness. Daniels v. Mobley, 285 Va. 402, 737 S.E.2d 895, 2013 V a. LEXIS 27 (2013). Legislative intent.  The General Assembly intended to allow the Commonwealth to elect to charge a defendant with multiple counts of violating this section, where the evidence proves t hat the statute was violated at separate and distinct times. Dingus v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 382, 477 S.E.2d 303, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 693 (1996). Construction.  While this section is penal in nature and must be strictly construed and any ambiguity as to its meaning resolved in the defendants favor, that does not mean that the defendant is entitled to a favorable result based on an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the Code. Dingus v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 382, 477 S.E.2d 303, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 693 (1996). This section is in pari materia with several other provisions on gambling, which calls i nto play the rule of construction that statutes relating to the same subject should be read and construed together. Turner v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 456, 309 S.E.2d 337, 1983 Va. LEXIS 305 (1983). Defendant need not be only per son in charge.  In order to bring defendant within the ambit of this section it was not necessary to show that he was the only person in charge. The statute was intended to bring within its sweep a co-commander, co-leader, or co-manager; moreover, where there is proof that a defendant played even a partial leadership role in the illegal gambling enterprise then he can be convicted under this section. Walton v. Commonwealth, No. 0388-85 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 12, 1986).  Bagman in numbers operation held not to be an operator.  See Turner v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 456, 309 S.E.2d 337, 1983 Va. LEXIS 305 (1983). Proof requirements.  To convict under this section, the Commonwealth need only prove that the defendant operated an illegal gambling enterprise, activity or operation. Dingus v. Commo nwealth, 23 Va. App. 382, 477 S.E.2d 303, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 693 (1996). Evidence of lead ership role in gambling operation.  Evidence that defendant arranged to lease the building where the gambling occurred, made the necessary renovations to the building, paid the monthly rent, handled the overhead for the club, gave instructions to handlers of the house money and personally handled and collected money from the dice games, showed that defendant played a leadership or management role in the gambling operation and the trier of f act could properly have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant actively conducted, managed, supervised or directed all or part of the gambling enterprise. Walton v. Commonwealth, No. 0388-85 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 12, 1986). Sports publications were hea rsay evidence.  Where sports publications were admitted into evidence to show that the betting sheets written by defendant corresponded with the seasons football and basketba ll schedules and win-loss records, the publications were hearsay and did not fall within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule, and the trial court erred in admitting them.

For related discussion, see 6A M.J. Disorderly Houses and Houses of Ill Fame, §§ 2, 3. CASE NOTES Stat utory scheme did not violate Equal Protection Clause.  The fact that solicitation to commit prostitution is a misdemeanor and is, therefore, considered a less serious crime than solicitation to commit a felony, § 1 8.2-29, which includes solicitation to commit sodomy, does not create an impermissible classification between groups of people similarly situated. Therefore, the court rejected the defendants claim that the statutory scheme violated the Equal Protect ion Clause. Branche v. Commonwealth, 25 Va. App. 480, 489 S.E.2d 692, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 570 (1997). No discrimination of one gender in absence of attempts to apprehend other gender.  The police do not intentionally discriminate against one gender by the absence of attempts to detect and apprehend offenders of the other gender, when no evidence is presented that offenders of the other gender are engaged in similar criminal behavior; the defendant offered no evidence that similarly situated females could have been prosecuted but were not.

Attempted prosti tution defined solely by section.  Attempted prostitution, unlike attempts to commit crimes generally, is defined solely by this section. Adams v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 257, 208 S.E.2d 742, 1974 Va . LEXIS 269 (1974). And, as so defined, is incorporated within the offense of prostitution itself. Adams v. C ommonwealth, 215 Va. 257, 208 S.E.2d 742, 1974 Va. LEXIS 269 (1974). Requirements for a ttempt to commit prostitution.  An attempt to commit prostitution requires an offer to engage in sexual intercourse for pay and a substantial act performed in furtherance of the offer. Adams v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 257, 208 S.E.2d 742, 1974 Va. LEXIS 269 (1974). Evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant used a vehicle to promote prostitution in violation of § 18.2-349, and the vehicle wa s also used to aid or promote prostitution in violation of § 18.2-348 because defendant not only committed substantial acts in furtherance of prostitution while in the vehicle by driving himself in the vehicle to the parking lot of the motel for the p urpose of engaging the services of a prostitute, he used his vehicle to transport himself to a place to be used for the purpose of prostitution; the evidence proved that defendant initiated a conversation with an undercover officer concerning a blow job, how much money he had, and whether she was a cop, and in addition, defendant asked the officer to take a ride at the outset of the conversation and engaged in substantial acts in furtherance of completing the sexual transaction.

How conviction sustain ed where no act occurred.  Where no act of adultery or fornication has occurred, a conviction under this section can be sustained only if the evidence shows an attempt to commit prostitutio n.

Public p olicy exception to employment-at-will doctrine.  Employee who alleged that he was forced to quit his job as a result of retaliatory conduct that supervisors directed at the employee after the employee refused to engage in sexual harassment at work sufficiently stated a claim for wrongful constructive discharge in violation of public policy because the employee was a member of the class of persons that the statutes forbidding fornication, sexual battery, aggrava ted sexual battery, and prostitution were designed to protect.

Commonwealth, 1 91 Va. 33, 59 S.E.2d 863, 1950 Va. LEXIS 195 (1950). The purpose of this section is to suppress commercial prostitution and to put a ban on a ny place where persons may meet for the purpose of illicit intercourse without fear of being molested or interfered with by the keeper thereof. Trent v. Commonwealth, 181 Va. 338, 25 S.E.2d 350, 1943 Va. LEXIS 184 (1943); Bennett v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 7, 28 S.E.2d 13, 1943 Va. LEXIS 124 (1943). What constitutes house of prostitu tion.  Every house where illicit sexual intercourse is indulged between a man and a woman is not necessarily a house of prostitution. In order to constitute such a house , it must have the elements of a public house; a house which many people may frequent for immoral purposes or a house where a person may go for immoral purposes without an invitation. Trent v. Commonwealth, 181 Va. 338, 25 S.E.2d 350, 1943 Va. LEXIS 184 (1943). A house of ill fame is not measured by the number of its rooms or inhabitants. It is not necessary that more than one woman inhabit or resort to a place for the purpose of prostitution in order for such place to constitute a house of ill fame. Trent v. Commonwealth, 181 Va. 338, 25 S.E.2d 350, 1943 Va. LEXIS 184 (1943). Bawdyhouse and house of ill fame are synonymous terms used in the law. W ilson v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 824, 111 S.E. 96, 1922 Va. LEXIS 81 (1922). Also house of prostitution is synonymous with house of ill fame. Trent v . Commonwealth, 181 Va. 338, 25 S.E.2d 350, 1943 Va. LEXIS 184 (1943). And brothel.  A bawdyhouse is also spoken of as a brothel. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 824, 111 S.E. 96, 1922 Va. LEXIS 81 (1922). Motel parking lot was bawdy place.  Evidence was sufficient to show that the motel parking lot was a bawdy place as defined by this section and city code § 29-24. Once contract had been made to g o to a reputed bawdy place for an immoral purpose, the ordinance was violated when the parties arrived at the parking lot. They were then visiting a bawdy place for the specific immoral purpose that the statute and ordinance were intended to suppress. Ha rrison v. City of Norfolk, 16 Va. App. 572, 431 S.E.2d 658, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1565, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 203 (1993).

Necessity for proving reputation.  In a prosecution for keeping a bawdyhouse it is not necessary to prove that the house had a general reputation as a bawdyhouse, where it is shown that it was in f act such a house. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 824, 111 S.E. 96, 1922 Va. LEXIS 81 (1922). Accused must know of i llegal practices in house.  Before one charged with violation of this section can be found guilty, he must possess knowledge of the illegal practices that are carried on in such place. Warsh aw v. City of Norfolk, 190 Va. 862, 58 S.E.2d 884, 1950 Va. LEXIS 176 (1950). Proof of knowledge of character of place.  In a prosecution for keeping a place where persons may meet for the purpose of illicit or illegal intercourse, it is not necessary for the state to prove actual k nowledge on the part of the accused of the character of his place, or of the inmates, or of those who resorted there, but such facts and circumstances may be shown as will convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was bound to have cogni zance, or knowledge, of the inmates of the house, or of those who resorted there. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 7, 28 S.E.2d 13, 1943 Va. LEXIS 124 (1943).

Bennett v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 7, 28 S.E.2d 13, 1943 Va. LEXIS 124 (1943). Sufficiency of evidence.  Evidence held sufficient to support conviction for keeping a house of ill fame, that is, a bawdyhouse or brothel. Foster v. Commonwealth, 179 Va. 96, 18 S.E.2d 31 4, 1942 Va. LEXIS 202 (1942); Wilson v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 824, 111 S.E. 96, 1922 Va. LEXIS 81 (1922). Evidence sufficient to support conviction for operating a bawdyhouse. Gaskill v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 486, 144 S.E.2d 293, 1965 Va. LEXIS 224 (1965). Instruction.  In a prosecution for violating this section, there was no error in the giving of an instruction that if the jury believed that accused kept a place where pers ons may meet for the purpose of illegal or illicit intercourse they should find him guilty. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 7, 28 S.E.2d 13, 1943 Va. LEXIS 124 (1943). Application of abstention doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S. Ct. 746, 27 L.

CASE NOTES Sections 18. 2-355 through 18.2-360 considered together.  Sections 18.2-355 through 18.2-360 are designed to prohibit illicit prostitution and procurement. Over a long period of time these sections have been considered t ogether because they are all designed to accomplish the same purpose, to prohibit any act of exploiting the prostitution of a female.

This section and § 18.2-357 accomplish same purpose.  This section prohibits pandering. It reaches the person who receives money for procuring any female to engage in unlawful sexual intercourse. But § 18.2-357 al so prohibits pandering. The two sections were enacted to accomplish the same purpose, prohibit commercial prostitution. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1978 Va. LEXIS 257 (1978). The conduct punished under this section and § 18.2-357 and the conduct sought to be reached by a conspiracy charge under these sections is sufficiently congrue nt to require the application of Whartons Rule, which is applicable where there exists a general congruence of the agreement and the completed substantive offense and under which the conspiracy and substantive offense merge when the substantive offen se is proved, at least where only the potential panderer and the potential prostitute are parties to the agreement alleged. Stewart v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 473, 303 S.E.2d 877, 1983 Va. LEXIS 244 (1983). The only difference between this section and § 18.2-357 is that under this section th e source of the money paid is immaterial and it can be received either before or after the procuring or the placing of the female. A violation does not depend upon an act of sexual intercourse having occurred. Under § 18.2-357 the money must be knowin gly received from the earnings of the female, and therefore after the act of prostitution. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1978 Va. LEXIS 257 (1978). A bellman in a hotel who is given $10 by a guest to procure for him a prostitute, and does so, violates this section. If he also receives from the prostitute a po rtion of her fee for the service she rendered the guest, he violates § 18.2-357. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1978 Va. LEXIS 257 (1978). One who effects a criminal act through an innocent agent is a principal in the first degree. Collins v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 223, 307 S.E.2d 884, 1983 Va. LEXIS 310 (1983). A defendant may not escape criminal responsibility for a crime which he arranges to have committed by an unwitting agent. Collins v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 223, 30 7 S.E.2d 884, 1983 Va. LEXIS 310 (1983). It is not the prostitute that this section and § 18.2-357 seek to reach but the one w ho profits from an act of prostitution by another. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1978 Va. LEXIS 257 (1978). Permissible amendment of indictment.  This section and § 18.2-357 are so interrelated that an indictment drawn under one could be subsequently amended to charge a violation of the other section if the evidence showed such a violation. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1978 Va. LEXIS 257 (1978). Because of the similarity of purpose and subject matter of this section and § 18.2-357, an amendment to an indictment which changes the provision under which a defendant is charged from § 18.2-357 to this section does not change the nature or character of the offense charged and is permissible under the provisions of § 19.2-231. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1978 Va. LEXIS 257 (19 78). An indictment following the language of this section was sufficient, and the contention that the words to cohabit with male persons do not imply sexual intercourse or connote sexual relations was without merit. Martin v. Commonwealth, 195 Va. 1107, 81 S.E.2d 574, 1954 Va. LEXIS 189 (1954). Defendant was properly convicted of the attempt to commit the crime of pandering where h e had placed a female in his room and solicited males to have intercourse with her, and was prevented from receiving the money only by the intervention of the police.

CASE NOTES Sections 18. 2-355 through 18.2-360 considered together.  Sections 18.2-355 through 18.2-360 are designed to prohibit illicit prostitution and procurement. Over a long period of time these sections have been considered t ogether because they are all designed to accomplish the same purpose, to prohibit any act of exploiting the prostitution of a female. It is immaterial whether the act be called pandering or pimping. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1 978 Va. LEXIS 257 (1978). Sectio n 18.2-356 and this section accomplish same purpose.  Section 18.2-356 prohibits pandering. It reaches the person who receives money for procuring any female to engage in unlawful sexual intercourse. But this section also prohibits pandering. The two sections were enacted to accomplish the same purpose, prohibit commercial prostitution. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1978 Va. LEXIS 257 (1978). The conduct punished under this section and § 18.2-356 and the conduct sought to be reached by a conspiracy charge under these sections is sufficiently congrue nt to require the application of Whartons Rule, which is applicable where there exists a general congruence of the agreement and the completed substantive offense and under which the conspiracy and substantive offense merge when the substantive offen se is proved, at least where only the potential panderer and the potential prostitute are parties to the agreement alleged.

LEXIS 257 (1978). A bellman in a hotel who is given $10.00 by a guest to procure for him a prostitute, and does so, violates § 18.2-356. If he also receives from the prostitute a portion of her fee for the service she rendered the guest, he violates this section. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1978 Va. LEXIS 257 (1978). It is not the prostitute that § 18.2-356 and this section seek to reach but the one w ho profits from an act of prostitution by another. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1978 Va. LEXIS 257 (1978). Prostitute is not accomplice.  In a prosecution under this section, the testimony of the prostitute was not that of an accomplice since the prostitute herself could not have been indicted under this section for receiving money from her own earnings. Clinton v. Commonwealth, 204 Va. 275, 130 S.E.2d 437, 1963 Va. LEXIS 144 (1963), rev'd, 377 U.S. 158, 84 S. Ct. 1186, 12 L. Ed. 2d 213, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 1366 (1964). Evidence that an accused received a part of the earnings of a prostitute on other occasions not too remote in time to the offense charged is admissible as tending to show a system or uniform plan from which motive, criminal intent or knowledge may be inferred. Minor v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 278, 191 S.E.2d 825, 1972 Va. LEXIS 347 (1972). Permissible amendment of indictment.  Section 18.2-356 and this section are so interrelated that an indictment drawn under one could be subsequently amended to charge a violation of the other section if the evidence showed such a violation. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1978 Va. LEXIS 257 (1978). Because of the similarity of purpose and subject matter of § 18.2-356 and this section, an amendment to an indictment which changes the provision under which a defendant is charged from this section to § 18.2-356 does not change the nature or character of the offense charged and is permissible under the provisions of § 19.2-231. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 994, 243 S.E.2d 834, 1978 Va. LEXIS 257 (19 78). An indictment was sufficient though it charged that money received by the accused from t he earnings of a prostitute was not for a consideration deemed good and valuable at law instead of charging that it was not for a consideration deemed good or valuable at law, which was the language of former § 18-97. Saunders v. Commo nwealth, 186 Va. 1000, 45 S.E.2d 307, 1947 Va. LEXIS 218 (1947). Exception lang uage creates an affirmative defense.  Exception language in § 18.2-357 creates an affirmative defense that places the burden of production on a defendant to show that there was some consideration g iven in exchange for the earnings of the prostitute. Tart v. Commonwealth, 52 Va. App. 272, 663 S.E.2d 113, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (2008). Jury ins truction as to exception language not required.  Because the exception language in § 18.2-357 was not an element of the offense, but rather an affirmative defense, defendant was required to satisfy the defend ants burden of producing or pointing to evidence that would allow the defendant to invoke the exception. Because the defendant failed to meet that threshold burden, the trial court did not err by refusing the defendants proposed jury instruction that placed the burden on the Commonwealth to prove that defendant did not give consideration deemed good and valuable in law in exchange for earnings the defendant received from a roommates prostitution. Tart v. Commonwealth, 52 Va. App. 272 , 663 S.E.2d 113, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (2008). Sufficient evidence of pandering.  Circuit court properly convicted defendant of pandering because the evidence showed that he assisted a woman in drafting an advertisement for prostitution and sat next to her while she posted the advertisement online, that he entered her hotel room and retrieved money that she had earned from engaging in prostitution, that the police found defendant in the room where the woman told police they would find her pimp , and that the police found cash on defendant and in the room.

B. Any person who violates subsection A through the use of force, intimidation, or deception is guilty of a Class 4 felony. C.

Carr v. Commonwealth, 69 Va. App. 106, 816 S.E.2d 591, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 199 (2018). Admissibility of character evidence.  Limiting defendants cross-examination of a victim about the victims prior drug dealing and prostitution did not violate defendants confrontation right because (1) the evidence defendant sought to elicit was minimally relevant, (2) a danger of jury confusion and unfair prejudice was high, (3) the jury already knew the victim was a drug addict, and (4) whether the victim had previously engaged in prosti tution was irrelevant to whether defendant intimidated the victim to engage in charged commercial sex acts.

Relevance of gang membership evidenc e.  Defendants gang membership was relevant because (1) the evidence was relevant to whether defendant intimidated a victim to engage in sex acts, which was an el ement of sex trafficking, and (2) a cautionary instruction was given. Lambert v. Commonwealth, 70 Va. App. 740, 833 S.E.2d 468, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 227 (2019). Sufficient evidence.  Sufficient evidence showed defendant committed sex trafficking because defendant forced a victim to commit prostitution, which paid for defendants hotel room. Carr v.

Court rejected defendants claim that § 18.2-361 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because § 18.2-361, on its face, did no t draw distinctions between homosexual and heterosexual individuals. Section 18.2-361 applies equally to all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation, and all persons, male or female, whether heterosexual or homosexual, who solicit another to commit an act of sodomy are guilty of a class 6 felony. Tjan v. Commonwealth, 46 Va. App. 698, 621 S.E.2d 669, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 447 (2005). Defendants convictions for four counts of sodomy were affirmed because subsection A of § 18.2-361 was constitutional as applied to defendant as his violati ons involved 16 and 17 year-old minors and therefore merited no protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. McDonald v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 325, 630 S.E.2d 754, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (2006), aff'd, 274 Va. 249, 645 S.E.2d 918, 2007 Va. LEXIS 87 (2007). Nothing in the United States Supreme Court opinion in Lawrence or the Supreme Court of Virginias opinion in Martin facially invalidates subsection A of § 18.2-361. McDonald v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 325, 630 S.E.2d 754, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (2006), aff'd, 274 Va. 249, 645 S.E.2d 918, 2007 Va. LEXIS 87 (2007). As defendants victims, 16 and 17, were minors as defined by § 1-207, his as-applied constitutional challenge to the sodomy statute, § 18.2-361, failed because nothing in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), or Martin v. Ziherl, 607 S.E.2d 367 (2005), prohibited the application of the sodomy statute to conduct between adults and minors. McDona ld v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 249, 645 S.E.2d 918, 2007 Va. LEXIS 87 (2007). Anti-sodomy provision of § 18.2-361 facially violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. MacDonald v. Moose, 710 F.3d 154, 2013 U.S. App. LEXI S 4921 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 571 U.S. 829, 134 S. Ct. 200, 187 L. Ed. 2d 45, 2013 U.S. LEXIS 5525 (2013). Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to impose sentence on defendants conviction for consensual sodomy with juveniles after defendant breached the term s of his suspended sentence because the sodomy statute was constitutional, particularly in the context of conduct between adults and minors. Saunders v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. App. 793, 753 S.E.2d 602, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 23 (2014), aff'd, No. 140507, 2015 Va. Unpub. LEXIS 18 (Va. Feb. 26, 2015). Applying ordinary principles that govern facial and as applied challenges led to the conclusion that § 18.2-361 was not facially invalid. Defendant did not rai se an as applied challenge and, therefore, his conviction for violating § 18.2-361 could properly be considered by the trial court in revoking his suspended sentences. McClary v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 152 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2014), aff' d, No. 140785, 2015 Va. Unpub. LEXIS 17 (Va. Feb. 26, 2015). It was proper to apply the normal rule by prohibiting those applications of this rule that were unconstitutional and leaving the constitutional applicatio ns of this rule to be enforced. Toghill v. Commonwealth, 289 Va. 220, 768 S.E.2d 674, 2015 Va. LEXIS 18 (2015). Because defendant solicited sodomy with a person whom he thought was a minor, defendant did not have standing to assert a facial challenge to the anti-sodomy prov isions of this section, because enforcement of the sodomy prohibition law was constitutional as applied to him. Toghill v. Commonwealth, 289 Va. 220, 768 S.E.2d 674, 2015 Va. LEXIS 18 (2015). District court properly denied petitioners habeas petition challenging his Virginia conviction for computer solicitation of acts of sodomy from minor under ag e of 15 because Virginias anti-sodomy statute, as authoritatively construed by Supreme Court of Virginia, did not criminalize conduct that United States Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas declared to be protected by liberty interests guaranteed by Du e Process Clause, and it was, therefore, not facially unconstitutional, and Supreme Court of Virginias decision to adopt that narrowing construction in petitioners case was not contrary to or unreasonable application of applicable United States S upreme Court precedent. Toghill v. Clarke, 877 F.3d 547, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 25369 (4th Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 223, 202 L. Ed. 2d 152, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 4914 (2018). Circuit court properly convicted defendant of soliciting another person to carnally know a brute animal or to submit to carnal knowledge with a brute animal  because the Virginia Supreme Courts conclusion that the pre-2014 version of the statute at issue was not facially unconstitutional was dispositive of defendants facial challenge to the current version of the statute, and the statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant where bestiality was a crime at common law, it had been criminalized in Virginia by statute, in one form or another, since at least 1792, and defendant did not identify any court that had concluded bestiality was a fundamental liberty interest protected by the due process clause. Warren v. Commonwealth, 69 Va. App. 659, 822 S.E.2d 395, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (2019). Section is not unconstitutional on its face. Doe v. Commonwealth's Att'y ex rel. City of Richmond, 403 F. Supp. 1199, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15606 (E.D. Va. 1975), aff'd, 425 U.S. 901, 96 S. Ct. 1489, 47 L.

CASE NOTES Section compared with § 20-38.1.  While the felony (this section) applies only to a person who, while already married, marries again, the misdemeanor (§ 20-38.1) is broader in scope and applies to any person, whether married or not, who enters into a marriage before the dissolution of an earlier marriage of one of the parties. Stuart v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 216, 397 S.E.2d 533, 7 Va. Law Rep. 599, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 182 (1990). Commonwealth could choose to charge defendant with felony rather than misdemeanor.  Attorney for the Commonwealth could choose to charge the defendant with a felony (this section) instead of a misdemeanor (§ 20-38.1); the mere fact that the de fendant may also have committed a lesser offense does not preclude the Commonwealth from charging a greater offense arising out of the same act or transaction. Stuart v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 216, 397 S.E.2d 533, 7 Va. Law Rep. 599, 1990 Va. App. LEX IS 182 (1990). Marria ge while still married to another is void ab initio.  Where parties took part in a marriage ceremony in South Carolina and at the time of the ceremony, husband had not secured a final decree of divorce from his first wife, which he subsequently obtained, the parties marriage in South Carolina was void ab initio, not merely voidable. Hager v. Hager, 3 Va. App. 415, 349 S.E.2d 908, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1151, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 376 (1986). Elements of offense of bigamy.  In order for a second marriage to constitute the crime of bigamy it is, of course, essential that the first marriage should have been a valid marriage, and that t he marital relation should have been subsisting between the parties thereto at the time the defendant entered into the second marriage. Warner v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 95 (1817); Moore v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 639, 1838 Va. LEXIS 56 ( 1838); Oneale v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 582, 1867 Va. LEXIS 28 (1867); Bird v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 800, 1871 Va. LEXIS 88 (1871). The subsequent marriage of the accused is of course an essential element of the crime. Farewell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 475, 189 S.E. 321, 1937 Va. LEXIS 291 (19 37). Under this section, the crime of bigamy is complete in this state if under an invalid marriage in another state there is thereafter cohabitation under such marria ge in this state. Corvin v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 649, 108 S.E. 651, 1921 Va. LEXIS 54 (1921); Farewell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 475, 189 S.E. 321, 1937 Va. LEXIS 291 (1937). Proof of validity of out-of-stat e marriage.  Where a prior marriage is alleged to have taken place in another state it must be shown that the marriage was valid where contracted. Warner v. Commonwealth, 4 Va . (2 Va. Cas.) 95 (1817); Oneale v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 582, 1867 Va. LEXIS 28 (1867); Bird v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 800, 1871 Va. LEXIS 88 (1871). Unmarried party to second marriage guilty of aiding and abetting.  An unmarried person who marries another, knowing that the latter is already married, may be convicted of aiding and abetting the commission of bigamy by the latte r even though this section does not in terms make the competent party to the bigamous marriage punishable. Adkins v. Commonwealth, 175 Va. 590, 9 S.E.2d 349, 1940 Va. LEXIS 204 (1940). What is necessary to give court jurisdiction.  Either the second unlawful marriage, or the cohabitation after the second unlawful marriage has been entered into out of this state, must take place within this s tate to give our courts jurisdiction. Neither the place of marriage nor the place of cohabitation is an element of the nature or character of the crime. Farewell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 475, 189 S.E. 321, 1937 Va. LEXIS 291 (1937). Reasonable bel ief that one is divorced is no defense.  Because the unambiguous language of this section does not require proof of a specific intent, reasonable belief that a prior marriage has been ended by divorce is not a defense to the charge of bigamy. Stuart v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 216, 397 S.E.2d 533, 7 Va. Law Rep. 599, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 182 (1990). As to evidence to prove former marriage, see Warner v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 95 (1817); Moore v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 639, 1838 Va. LEXIS 56 (1838); Oneale v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 582, 1867 Va. LEXIS 28 (1867); Bird v. Commonwealth, 62 Va.

Bigamy both illegal and void.  Because defendant married a second wife while married to his first wife, because this section clearly condemned bigamy as both illegal and void, and because defen dants two-year minimum prison term fell far short of implicating any Eighth Amendment issue, there was no merit in any of defendants statutory or constitutional challenges. Cole v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. App. 642, 712 S.E.2d 759, 2011 Va. App. LEXI S 255 (2011). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Void marriages.  Virginias laws voiding bigamous marriages and criminalizing bigamy are constitutional; the Fourth Circuits decision in Bostic v. Schaefer does not invalidate §§ 18.2-362, 18.2-363, 20-38.1, 20-40, and 20-45.1, which prohibit bigamy by all persons , regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

CASE NOTES Void foreign decree of divorce renders second marriage bigamous.  If the accused did not go to West Virginia with the determination to make it his legal domicile, or if he went there merely for the purpose of obtaining a divorce , intending to remain no longer than was necessary to accomplish his purpose, or if the divorce was obtained by fraud, the decree of the West Virginia court is void, and the accused in marrying another woman and thereafter cohabiting with her in this sta te, while his former wife still was living, is guilty of bigamy. Corvin v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 649, 108 S.E. 651, 1921 Va. LEXIS 54 (1921). Evidence of fraud in obtaining decree.  Where a divorce decree in another state was relied upon by accused as a defense, the material facts which culminated in the divorce suit, as well as his conduct i mmediately thereafter, are admissible to determine whether the decree had been obtained in good faith or by deceit and fraud. Corvin v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 649, 108 S.E. 651, 1921 Va. LEXIS 54 (1921). Indictment for bigamy need not negative provisions of this section.  In a prosecution for bigamy, it is not necessary that the indictment should negative the provisions of this section, as this section constitutes no part of the de scription of the offense, but is disconnected with the statutory description of the crime and only affords the accused certain grounds of defense, among them a divorce from the bond of a previous marriage.

Circumstantial evidence in the nature of Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) test results showing a probability of paternity was insufficient as a matter of law to find defendant guilty of incest, where the Commonwealths own evidence, including the testimony of expert regarding the lack of statistical information concerning the effect which incestuous relationships have on increasing the probability of the HLA resu lts indicating paternity, and the denial by the alleged victim that intercourse occurred between her and defendant, created a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of the crime charged. Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 523, 351 S.E.2d 598, 3 Va . Law Rep. 1521, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 392 (1986). Evidence sufficient to prove pater nity.  Where an alleged incest victim and her mother identified defendant as the victims father, he was listed as her father on the birth certificate, the victim was born during defendants marriage to the victims mother, and the victim used defendants surname throughout her life, the evidence was sufficient to prove defendants paternity. Dowdy v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 705 (Va. Ct. App. De c. 30, 2003). Constitutional argument insufficie nt.  Contrary to defendants argument, there was no constitutional right for a stepfather to engage in sexual intercourse with his eighteen-year-old stepdaughter, a nd this section, prohibiting it that was enacted by the peoples elected representatives in the General Assembly was constitutional. Ferguson v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. App. 546, 838 S.E.2d 75, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (2020). Evidence sufficient to support conviction for rape and incest.  Trial court did not err in convicting defendant of rape and of incest because the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions, despite defendants conte ntion that the victims testimony was inherently incredible as a matter of law and that the jury wrongfully rejected his claim of innocence. The testimony supported the jurys conclusion, defendants sperm was found in the victims vagina and defendants hypothesis of innocence was not reasonable or believable based on the facts. Greason v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 104 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 14, 2023). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Fifth Amendment right.  Because there was no statute of limitations for a felony, if plaintiff had sexual intercourse with his daughter or granddaughter, or his mother, he could invoke h is right under the Fifth Amendment as such sexual intercourse was a felony. Zakia v. Zakia, 104 Va. Cir. 168, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 7 (Fairfax County Jan. 24, 2020). Incest is not a lesser included offense of rape, as under this section, the incest statu te, the Commonwealth has to prove a familial relationship and there is no requirement that it be nonconsensual, while lack of consent is an element of rape, and not every commission of rape was a commission of incest.

CASE NOTES Failure to provide medical treatment.  Evidence that defendant knowingly and willfully failed to provide medical treatment to her incapacitated mother even though the doctor instructed defendant to bri ng her mother to his office if she experiences any problems, was sufficient to support her conviction for felonious abuse or neglect of her mother that resulted in serious bodily injury or disease. Correll v. Commonwealth, 269 Va. 3, 607 S.E.2d 119, 2005 Va. LEXIS 14 (2005). There was sufficient evidence of proximate causation to support the jurys verdict that defendants actions were a proximate cause of the victims death as defendant, the owner of a residential group home for people with intellectual disabilities, directed that the victim was not to be taken to a hospital after the victim was burned by hot water when there was evidence that the victim would not have died of sepsis days later or the victims pneumonia would have been prevented if the victim had received proper treatment.

CASE NOTES The word lascivious is not defined in this section and must therefore be given i ts ordinary meaning. As so determined, the word lascivious describes a state of mind that is eager for sexual indulgence, desirous of inciting to lust or of inciting sexual desire and appetite. McKeon v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 24, 175 S.E.2d 282, 1970 Va. LEXIS 204 (1970); Campbell v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 196, 313 S.E.2d 402, 1984 Va. LEXIS 282 (1984). Actual touching not within section.  This section does not encompass situations where the accused has actually touched the victim or the victim was caused to touch the accused. Mason v. Commonwealth, No. 0309-97-2 (Ct. of Appeals May 5, 1998). Expose defined.  Expose for purposes of this statute means not only to lay bare to view, but to feel or touch; to limit exposure to visual observation unduly limits the behavior t hat the statute intends to prevent. Farhoumand v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 353 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 3, 2013), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 288 Va. 338, 764 S.E.2d 95, 2014 Va. LEXIS 150 (2014). Expose, as used in this section, requires a visual display where the genitalia are seen, or where there is a possibility that they could have been seen. F arhoumand v. Commonwealth, 288 Va. 338, 764 S.E.2d 95, 2014 Va. LEXIS 150 (2014). Expose element.  Defendant sent photographs of his genitals to the minor victim via Snapchat, which messages laid open to view his genitals, and the messages he sent satisfied the expose element of the statute. Hillman v. Commonwealth, 811 S.E.2d 853, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 84 (Va. Ct. App. 2018). Nothing in case law places a limitation on the term expose by requiring that, to satisfy the statute, the exposure must occur in the physical presence of the victim; expose requires exposure in the actual presence and sight of others, or in such a place or under such circumstances that the exhibition is liable to be seen by others. Hillman v. Commonwealth, 811 S.E.2d 853, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 84 (Va. Ct. A pp. 2018). Physical presence element.  By ensuring that the victim had his correct user name, and then confirming that she had received a Snapchat from him, defendant was clearly exposing himself to th e victim in a manner liable to be seen by her, and his behavior satisfied the physical presence or liable to be seen requirement under the statute. Hillman v. Commonwealth, 811 S.E.2d 853, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 84 (Va. Ct. App. 2018). This section and § 18.2-68 deal with different approaches to a sexual offense. Black v . Peyton, 292 F. Supp. 45, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9551 (W.D. Va. 1968). And different evidence is required to support convictions under this section and former § 18.2-68. Black v. Peyton, 292 F. Supp. 45, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9551 (W.D. Va. 1968). Former § 18.1-215 contemplated an intentional act of a person over 21 [now 18] years of age placing the hands upon or in any manner fondling or feeling the sexual or genital parts of a child under 14 years of age with lascivious intent. Black v. Peyton, 292 F. Supp. 45, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9551 (W.D. Va. 1968). At time of exposure.  Conversation between defendant and the minor victim via text message occurred at the same time as their exchange of explicit Snapchat messages, and defendant aske d the victim if she had received his Snapchat message, and she responded in the affirmative within 20 seconds, such that she viewed defendants genitals at time of the exposure...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-371"><akn:num>§ 18.2-371</akn:num><akn:heading>Causing or encouraging acts rendering children delinquent, abused, etc</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>; penalty; abandoned infant.

If the prosecution under this section is based solely on the accused parent having left the child at a hospital or emergency medical services agency, it shall be an aff irmative defense to prosecution of a parent under this section that such parent safely delivered the child within the first 30 days of the childs life to (a) a hospital that provides 24-hour emergency services, (b) an attended emergency medical servi ces agency that employs emergency medical services personnel, or (c) a newborn safety device located at and operated by such hospital or emergency medical services agency.

CASE NOTES Not essential that accused caused the commission of the misdemeanor.  It is not an essential element of the offense that accused should have caused the prosecutrix to commit a misdemeanor. If he encouraged her to commit a misdemeano r, he was guilty of the statutory offense. Bibbs v. Commonwealth, 129 Va. 768, 106 S.E. 363, 1921 Va. LEXIS 134 (1921). For a child to be in need of services as an element of this section, circumstanc es specified in either § 16.1-228 (i) or (ii) must have rendered court intervention essential to resolve the difficulty. DeAmicis v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 751, 514 S.E.2d 788, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 299 (1999), different results reached on reh'g, 31 Va. App. 437, 524 S.E.2d 151, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (2000). It is not an essential element of the offense under this section that the accused should have caused the juvenile to commit the misdemeanor. It is suffici ent if he encouraged such commission. This is so because the prohibition in the section is in the disjunctive against any person who shall cause or encourage the commission of a misdemeanor. Hubbard v. Commonwealth, 207 Va. 673, 152 S.E.2d 250, 1 967 Va. LEXIS 122 (1967). Evidence that defendant encouraged smoking of marijuana insufficient.  The evidence was insufficient to support the conviction of the mother of a 15 year-old boy under this section where, although the mother knew her son and his frie nds smoked marijuana in the garage, there was no evidence that the mother affirmatively encouraged this activity and the mother attempted, although unsuccessfully and perhaps ineffectually, to discourage the activity. Peace v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 725 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 14, 2000). Examples of encouragement.  Where in a prosecution under this section accused admitted that he had carnal intercourse with the prosecutrix and was, therefore, a willing participant with her in the commission of the misdemeanor, such participation, in itself alone, encouraged the prosecutrix to commit such misdemeanor and made the accused guilty under the statute. Bibbs v. Commonwealth, 129 Va. 768, 106 S.E. 363, 1921 Va. LEXIS 134 (1921). In a prosecution under this section for encouraging a child to commit a misdemeanor, namely, fornication, even if it were true that the prosecutrix made the first advance, that did not justify the accused in encouraging her to commit the misdemeanor by yielding to her solicitation. Bibbs v. Commonwealth, 129 Va. 768, 106 S.E. 363, 1921 Va. LEXIS 134 (1921). Contributing to the delinquenc y of a minor.  Reasonable officer would have had a basis for suspecting that plaintiff visitor was contributing to the delinquency of a minor, pursuant to § 18.2-371, because a stepfather had identified his missing stepson as one of the young men in the window of the house and the visitors actions could have led a reasonable officer to believe that the visitor sought to unlawfully conceal the stepson from his concerned s tepfather. Smith v. Ray, 409 Fed. Appx. 641, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 2191 (4th Cir. 2011). Misdemeanor contributing to the delinquency of a minor by abuse or neglect does not require proof that the foreseeable risk resulted in actual harm to the child; this lesser crime, in part, is complete upon proof that the appellant knew or should have known that his or her intentional conduct involving his or her child created a substantial risk of injury. Miller v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 527, 769 S.E.2d 706, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 98 (2015). By the statutes clear language, an individual who willfully contributes to, encourages, or causes a child to engage in a criminal activity, where the child ac tually commits the crime, has committed the offense of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Gibson v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (Va. Ct. App. July 23, 2019). Defendant was improperly convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor under § 18.2-371 because her acts and omissions did not satisfy the willfu l requirement as the evidence at most showed that defendant was home, sleeping in her sons bed, when he snuck out and that she possibly had failed to secure one of the houses door locks the night before. Unger v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 7 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 10, 2023) Solicitation of oral sex.  By unsuccessfully soliciting oral sex from a minor, defendant willfully encouraged her to engage in a criminal act in violation of § 18.2-29. As his solicitati on was clearly designed to encourage her to commit that act, which would have rendered her delinquent under § 16.1-228, the evidence established that he contributed to the delinquency of a minor in violation of § 18.2-371. MacDonald v. Commonwealth , 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 7 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 9, 2007). Compared to § 18.2-371.1.  Felony child neglect conviction was upheld, as evidence of defendants gross, wanton and willful conduct was presented by his act of brutally beating his mothe r in front of his eight-year-old son, leaving the son alone with his unconscious grandmother at night, and instructing his son not to call for help; the fact that the risks in doing so had not yet materialized did not mean that the risks were absent and did not serve to remove defendants conduct from the prohibitions of the statute. Jones v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 561 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2004). Defendant sufficiently preserved for review the claim that defendant could not be convicted of violating § 18.2-371, misdemeanor child abuse and neglect, becau se defense counsel made numerous arguments that defendant had no...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-372"><akn:num>§ 18.2-372</akn:num><akn:heading>Obscene defined</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The word obscene where it appears in this article shall mean that which, considered as a whole, has as its dominant theme or purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement , excretory functions or products thereof or sadomasochistic abuse, and which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters and which, taken as a whole, does not have serious literary, artistic, pol itical or scientific value.

Va. 1987). Exercise of police power.  The Commonwealth of Virginia, in the exercise of its police power, may properly determine that public exhibition of or traffic in obscenity may be contrary to the public interest. The Commonwealth, acting through the General Assembly, has made such a determination in enacting the state obscenity laws and authorizing local governing bodies to adopt similar local ordinances. KMA, Inc. v. City of Newport News, 228 V a. 365, 323 S.E.2d 78, 1984 Va. LEXIS 313 (1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1100, 105 S. Ct. 2324, 85 L. Ed. 2d 842, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 1787 (1985). Interpretation by Supreme Court.  For the purpose of testing the constitutionality of Virginias statute, the interpretation by the Supreme Court is as definitive as if the statute had been ame nded by the legislature. Grove Press, Inc. v. Evans, 306 F. Supp. 1084, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8854 (E.D. Va. 1969). The definition of obscenity adopted by Virginia courts fully complies with the constitut ional standards prescribed by the Supreme Court. Grove Press, Inc. v. Evans, 306 F. Supp. 1084, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8854 (E.D. Va. 1969). The definition of obscenity approved by Virginias highest court is binding upon the states trial courts and magistrates. Grove Press, Inc. v. Evans, 306 F . Supp. 1084, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8854 (E.D. Va. 1969). The Supreme Court has narrowed the definition of obscenity by judicial construction. Pric e v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). Obscenity.  Obscenity is defined in the following terms: Whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest. Under this definition, as elaborated in subsequent cases, three elements must coalesce: It must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value. Grove Press, Inc. v. Evans, 306 F . Supp. 1084, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8854 (E.D. Va. 1969). In the definition of obscenity three elements must coalesce: it must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prur ient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value. Price v. Co mmonwealth, 213 Va. 113, 189 S.E.2d 324, 1972 Va. LEXIS 316 (1972), vacated, 413 U.S. 912, 93 S. Ct. 3049, 37 L. Ed. 2d 1031 (1973). In House v. Commonwealth , 210 Va. 121, 169 S.E.2d 572 (1969), the Supreme Court expressly recognized that in determining whether a publication was constitutionally protected, Virginia courts were bound by the Supreme Courts definition of obscenity found in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1498 (1957) as amplified and explained in A Book Named John Clelands Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure v. Attorney Gen., 383 U.S. 413, 86 S. Ct. 975, 16 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1966). Consequently, in a prosecution charging the sale of obscene magazines, the Supreme Court found the evidence to be insufficient to support a conviction when measured by the following test: Whether to the average person , applying contemporary community standards: (1) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest; (2) that is a shameful or morbid patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (3) the material is utterly without redeeming social value. Grove Press, Inc. v. Evans, 306 F. Supp. 1084, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8854 (E.D. Va. 1969). Court of appeals erred in affirming defendants conviction for harassment by computer in violation § 18.2-152.7:1 because it should not have substituted a d ictionary definition of obscene for that provided by the general assembly in § 18.2-372; the general assembly provided a definition of obscene in § 18.2-372 to comport with constitutional requirements, and there was no suggestion th at the definition was constitutionally infirm. Barson v. Commonwealth, 284 Va. 67, 726 S.E.2d 292, 2012 Va. LEXIS 121 (2012). Although defendants behavior was inappropriate, it did not rise to the level of obscenity required under § 18.2-387, as defined in § 18.2-372, and defen dants conviction of indecent exposure was improper; nothing in the record suggested that defendant invited any sexual conduct with the victim, hinted at any sexual excitement on defendants part, or, when defendant dropped defendants pants upo n exiting a bus (with defendants back to the victim and running away from the victim), displayed defendants sexual organs to the victim or to anyone else. A. M. v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 46 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 12, 2013). A prurient interest is a shameful or morbid interest, in sex. Price v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 113, 189 S.E.2d 324, 1972 Va. LEXIS 316 (1972), vacated, 413 U.S. 912, 93 S. Ct. 3049, 37 L. Ed. 2d 1031 (1973). Virginia juries have traditionally relied on local rather than statewide community standards. Price v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 1 65, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). It would be difficult, if not impossible, for a Virginia jury to formulate a statewide standard of obscenity, for the state comprises communities with a vast dive rsity of life styles. Materials which do not offend the community standards of the metropolitan areas might well be regarded as obscene by the standards of some rural communities. Price v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, ce rt. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). To be obscene, conduct must violate contemporary community standards of sexual candor. C opeland v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. App. 512, 525 S.E.2d 9, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 112 (2000). Expert testimony regarding community standards is not required because the fact finder m ay apply his or her knowledge in ascertaining the acceptable standard in the community. Copeland v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. App. 512, 525 S.E.2d 9, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 112 (2000). Using the § 18.2-372 definition of obscene, defendants use of whore and repeated use of fuck you in an instant message were insuffi cient to permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude the references were obscene. Although the words were sexually explicit, defendants usage of the words was not erotic and did not have the purpose to appeal to a prurient interest in sex, but was used in...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-373"><akn:num>§ 18.2-373</akn:num><akn:heading>Obscene items enumerated</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Obscene items shall include: (1) Any obscene book; (2) Any obscene leaflet, pamphlet, magazine, booklet, picture, painting, bumper sticker, drawing, photograph, film, negative, slide, motion picture, videotape recording; (3) Any obscene figure, object, article, instrument, novelty device, or recording or transcription used or intended to be used in disseminating any obscene song, ballad, words, or sound s; or (4) Any obscene writing, picture or similar visual representation, or sound recording, stored in an electronic or other medium retrievable in a perceivable form.

Commonwealth, 210 Va. 121, 169 S.E.2d 572, 1969 Va. LEXIS 208 (1969). The determination whether a particular motion picture, book, or other work of expression is obscene is not merely a factual matter on which a jurys verdict is conclusive, but also involves an issue of constitutional law which must ultimately be decided by the court. House v. Commonwealth, 210 Va. 121, 169 S.E.2d 572, 1969 Va. LEXIS 20 8 (1969). It cannot be assumed that jurors in themselves necessarily express or reflect community standards. House v. Commonwealth, 210 Va. 121, 169 S.E.2d 572, 1969 Va. LEXIS 208 (1969). Expert evidence.  To sanction convictions without expert evidence of community standards encourages the jury to condemn as obscene such conduct or material as is personally distast eful or offensive to the particular juror. House v. Commonwealth, 210 Va. 121, 169 S.E.2d 572, 1969 Va. LEXIS 208 (1969). Burden of proof.  Since this section provides punishment for every person who knowingly . . . distributes . . . any obscene item, the burden is on the Commonwealth to show that magazines are obscene and that a defendant knew they were obscene when he distributed them to retail dealers. House v. Commonwealth, 210 Va. 121, 169 S.E.2d 572, 1969 Va. LEXIS 208 (1969). Necessity for judicial determination that matter is in fact obscene.  A person may not be forced to go through the hardship of defending himself against a criminal prosecution  with its consequent chilling effect on him and the community at large  for possessing, selling, or promoting, etc., publications or film without the government first having judicially ascertained whether the matter for the possession, etc., of which he is being prosecuted is, in fact, obscene. Greenm ount Sales, Inc. v. Davila, 344 F. Supp. 860, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12922 (E.D. Va. 1972), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 479 F.2d 591, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9786 (4th Cir. 1973). Unconstitutional seizure.  A seizure of allegedly obscene books on the authority of a warrant issued on the strength of the conclusory assertion of a single police officer, without any scru tiny by the judge of any materials considered obscene, is an unconstitutional seizure. Lee Art Theatre, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 210 Va. 315, 170 S.E.2d 769, 1969 Va. LEXIS 242 (1969). Conviction of possessing and exhibiting lewd and obscene motion pictures in violation of this section was reversed because of admission in evidence of films in qu estion which were seized under authority of warrant issued by justice of the peace solely upon conclusory assertions of police officer without any inquiry by the justice of the peace into the factual basis for the officers conclusions. Lee Art Theatr e, Inc. v. Virginia, 392 U.S. 636, 88 S. Ct. 2103, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1313, 1968 U.S. LEXIS 1145 (1968). A city is simply entitled to retain single copies of allegedly obscene material for purp oses of prosecution. Greenmount Sales, Inc. v. Davila, 479 F.2d 591, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9786 (4th Cir. 1973). Where only single copies of allegedly obscene materials were seized and others were left on the shelves, neither the authors First Amendment right to expression nor the publics right to know is infringed. Such seizure by the police is a procedure justified by the requirements of effective law enforcement and is not prohibited by the First Amendment as a prior restraint on the circulation and dissemination of books in violation of the constitutional restrictions against abridgment of freedom of speech and press. Greenmount Sales, Inc. v. Davila, 479 F.2d 591, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 97 86 (4th Cir. 1973). Evidence of probable cause for arrest.  There was no evidence of probable cause upon which the officers could have lawfully arrested defendant for violation of the obscenity law, when in searching for m arijuana, one of the officers opened a chest of drawers belonging to defendant and found in it seven nude pictures. There was no prima facie evidence that defendant was violating the law. Upton v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 445, 177 S.E.2d 528, 1970 V a. LEXIS 268 (1970). Evidence sufficient to uphold conviction.  There was no error by a trial court in convicting appellant of use of a communication system to solicit a child under the age of 15 to engage in sexual acts, in v iolation of Va. Code Ann. § 18.2-374(C), because the court considered the totality of the evidence, which proved the elements of appellants offenses beyond reasonable doubt. Bean v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 597 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 22, 2022 ). Evidence w as insufficient to support a conviction, etc. Evidence was insufficient to support a conviction where the evidence showed that the def endant threw a magazine at a minor, but the magazine was destroyed before trial, and the only evidence of its content was the minors testimony that he thought it was a Playboy magazine and that it had photographs of like dirty stuff. Hartman v. Commonwealth, No. 0569-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 30, 1999). Evidence that defendant mailed an envelope containing obscene photographs to a television station office in Hampton, that the photographs depicted defendant in va rious stages of undress, and that defendant included personal information as an invitation for a news anchor to contact defendant, supported defendants conviction for distributing obscene material under § 18.2-374. Newby v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 231 (Va. Ct. App. May 19, 2009). § 18.2-374.1.

Evans, 306 F. Supp. 1084, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8854 (E.D. Va. 1969). It is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad in light of the new test of obscenity pr omulgated in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973), which establishe d the following guidelines for the trier of fact to use in determining whether a work is obscene: (a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Price v. Com monwealth, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). But gives fair notice of the meaning of obscenity. Price v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 490, 20 1 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). A person of ordinary understanding would have no difficulty in determining what sorts of material would be regarded as obscene under this section. Price v. Common wealth, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). The conduct whose portrayal is proscribed must be specifically defined by statute, as wr itten or as authoritatively construed. Price v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). Examples of descriptions that are sufficiently specific are patently offensive represent ations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated and patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals. Price v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). This section prohibits only hard core pornography such as these examples, delineated by the United States Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 149, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973); Price v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. E d. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). And does not restrict constitutionally protected speech and writing. Price v. Commonwealt h, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). This section limits the class of works which might be found obscene to portrayals of sex ual activity or excretion, not including mere nudity, which go beyond the customary limits of candor in representing such matters. Price v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed . 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). This section applies only to persons who knowingly violate its provisions, but a ll that is required is to show that the defendant exhibited the film knowing its content. Price v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 113, 189 S.E.2d 324, 1972 Va. LEXIS 316 (1972), vacated, 413 U.S. 912, 93 S. Ct. 3049, 37 L. Ed. 2d 1031 (1973). It would be difficult, if not impossible, for a Virginia jury to formulate a statewide standard of obscenity, for the state comprises communities with a vast dive rsity of life styles. Materials which do not offend the community standards of the metropolitan areas might well be regarded as obscene by the standards of some rural communities. Price v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, ce rt. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). Since under Miller v. California , 413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973), national standards are not constitutionally required in obscenity cases, neither are statewide standards compelled. Price v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798, 1974 Va. LEXIS 165, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 902, 95 S. Ct. 186, 42 L. Ed. 2d 148, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2997 (1974). Local governing bodies not prevented from enacting public nudity ordinances.  State laws do not prevent a local governing body, under its police power, from enacting public nudity ordinances not inconsistent with the state law prohibiting c onduct which the local governing body reasonably deems to be contrary to the morals, health, safety and general welfare of the community.

When an ord er to show cause is issued pursuant to this article, and upon four days notice to be given to the persons and in the manner prescribed by the court, the court may issue a temporary restraining order against the sale or distribution of the book allege d to be obscene. F. On or befor e the return date specified in the order to show cause, the author, publisher, and any person interested in the sale or commercial distribution of the book may appear and file an answer. The court may by order permit any other person to appear and file a n answer amicus curiae. G. If no one a ppears and files an answer on or before the return date specified in the order to show cause, the court, upon being satisfied that the book is obscene, shall order the clerk of court to enter judgment that the book is obscene, but the court in its discre tion may except from its judgment a restricted category of persons to whom the book is not obscene. H. If an appea rance is entered and an answer filed, the court shall order the proceeding set on the calendar for a prompt hearing. The court shall conduct the hearing in accordance with the rules of civil procedure applicable to the trial of cases by the court without a jury. At the hearing, the court shall receive evidence, including the testimony of experts, if such evidence be offered, pertaining to: 1. The a rtistic, literary, medical, scientific, cultural and educational values, if any, of the book considered as a whole; 2. The degree of public acceptance of the book, or books of similar character, within the county or city in which the proceeding is brought; 3. The intent of the author and publisher of the book; 4. The reputation of the author and publisher; 5. The advertising, promotion, and other circumstances relating to the sale of the book; 6. The nature of classes of persons, including scholars, scientists, and physicians, for whom the book may not have prurient appeal, and who may be subject to exception pursuant to subsec tion G. I. In making a decision on the obscenity of the book, the court shall consider, among other things, the evidence offered pursuant to subsection H, if any, and shall make a written determination upon every such consideration relied upon in the proceeding in his finding s of fact and conclusions of law or in a memorandum accompanying them. J. If he finds the book not obscene, the court shall order the clerk of court to enter judgment accordingly. If he finds the book obscene, the court shall order the clerk of court to enter judgment that the book is obscene, but the court, in its discretion, may except from its judgment a restricted category of persons to whom the book is not obscene. K. While a tem porary restraining order made pursuant to subsection E is in effect, or after the entry of a judgment pursuant to subsection G, or after the entry of judgment pursuant to subsection J, any person who publishes, sells, rents, lends, transports in intrasta te commerce, or commercially distributes or exhibits the book, or has the book in his possession with intent to publish, sell, rent, lend, transport in intrastate commerce, or commercially distribute or exhibit the book, is presumed to have knowledge tha t the book is obscene under §§ 18.2-372 through 18.2-378 of this article. L. Any party t o the proceeding, including the petitioner, may appeal from the judgment of the court to the Court of Appeals, as otherwise provided by law. M. It is expre ssly provided that the petition and proceeding authorized under this article, relating to books alleged to be obscene, shall be intended only to establish scienter in cases where the establishment of such scienter is thought to be useful or desirable by the petitioner; and the provisions of § 18.2-384 shall in nowise be construed to be a necessary prerequisite to the filing of criminal charges under this article.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  This section provides a sufficiently definite procedure for determining whether certain materials alleged to be obscene are, in fact, obscene, and is therefore no t unconstitutionally vague. Alexander v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 539, 203 S.E.2d 441, 1974 Va. LEXIS 172 (1974). Movie films are to be accorded the same constitutional protection as books. Greenmount Sa les, Inc. v.

No distinction can be made between seizure for condemnation and seizure for evidence.  No distinction can rationally be made between the seizure of publications and film for condemnation, and seizure for evidence in a criminal prosecution. Both type s of seizure must be treated the same, for to do otherwise would sanction indiscriminate police fishing expeditions. Greenmount Sales, Inc. v. Davila, 344 F. Supp. 860, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12922 (E.D. Va. 1972), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 479 F.2 d 591, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9786 (4th Cir. 1973). The magnitude of a particular seizure of allegedly obscene materials is not a viable determinant of whether a persons or societys right to freedom of speech and press has been abridged.

The community standard for obscenity is that of the locality rather than that of the Sta te or nation. Alexander v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 539, 203 S.E.2d 441, 1974 Va. LEXIS 172 (1974). Prior judici al determination of obscenity required.  A prior adversary judicial hearing must be conducted before allegedly obscene books can be seized by government authorities. Greenmount Sales, Inc. v. Davila, 344 F. Supp. 860, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12922 (E.D. Va. 1972), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 479 F.2d 591, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9786 (4th Cir. 1973). A person may not be forced to go through the hardship of defending himself against a criminal prosecution  with its consequent chilling effect on him and the community at large  for possessing, selling, or promoting, etc., publications or film, without the government first having judicially ascertained whether the matter for the possession, etc., of which he is being prosecuted is, in fact, obscene.

It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly and intentionally create any videographic or still image by any means whatsoever of any nonconsenting person if (i) that person is totally nude, clad in undergarments, or in a state of undress so as to expose the gen itals, pubic area, buttocks or female breast in a restroom, dressing room, locker room, hotel room, motel room, tanning bed, tanning booth, bedroom or other location; or (ii) the videographic or still image is created by placing the lens or image-gatheri ng component of the recording device in a position directly beneath or between a persons legs for the purpose of capturing an image of the persons intimate parts or undergarments covering those intimate parts when the intimate parts or undergarme nts would not otherwise be visible to the general public; and when the circumstances set forth in clause (i) or (ii) are otherwise such that the person being recorded would have a reasonable expectation of privacy. B.

Rev. 339 (2009). CASE NOTES Nonconsenting person.  Although the trial court erred in concluding that the eight-year-old minor victim, as a matter of law, was a nonconsenting person due to the victims age, the error was harmless because the totality of the evidence led inexorably to the conclusion that the victim was unaware that the victim was being filmed surreptitiously in the victims bedroom, rendering the victim a nonconsenting person for purposes of defendants trial for filming the victim without the victims consent on multiple occasions. Blackwell v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. App. 30, 854 S.E.2d 191, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 29 (2021). Expectation of privacy.  Because the victim was wearing clothing covering her undergarments while shopping in a public location, the trial court did not err in finding that she had a reas onable expectation of privacy as to those undergarments for purposes of § 18.2-386.1; under § 18.2-386.1, a person can possess a reasonable expectation of privacy when being victimized in public, and the requirement in clause (ii) of subsection A t hat the victims intimate parts or undergarments covering those intimate parts not otherwise be visible to the general public is simply a standard by which to assess whether the victims intimate parts or undergarments were reasonably out o f view, as a prerequisite to finding that the accused has viewed them unlawfully. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 53 Va. App. 599, 673 S.E.2d 923, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 137 (2009). Evidence was sufficient to support the jurys finding that defendant recorded the victim when she had a reasonable expectation of privacy because the evidence showed that the victim was in her bedroom, at the time the recording began the victim was shielding her naked body from defendant and the camera with a blanket, the victim pleaded with defendant to stop recording her, and she considered leaving the apart ment but did not so because she was naked. Haba v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. App. 277, 858 S.E.2d 436, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 92 (2021). Defendants conviction for unlawful creation of images of another was affirmed because this statute prohibited recording another person, naked, without her con sent, when in her bedroom, where she had a reasonable expectation of privacy; there was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the victim was truthful when she said she was unaware of, and thus non-consenting to, the recordings of her and defendan t engaging in sexual activity; and the fact-finder was entitled to disbelieve the authenticity and validity of the contract that defendant offered into evidence as proof that the victim had provided written consent to film her. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 7 3 Va. App. 393, 860 S.E.2d 408, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 133 (2021). Other location does not include public forum.  The general words, other location, as used in the statute did not apply to the defendants videotaping from under the dress of a fully clothed person s tanding at a public forum, i.e., a county fairgrounds. CDebaca v. Commonwealth, No. 2754-97-4 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 2, 1999) (decided prior to 2005 amendment which added A(ii)). Evidence sufficient.  Evidence was sufficient for the trial court to rationally find defendant guilty of attempting to photograph a victim in violation of § 18.2-386.1 because defen dant was charged with and convicted of attempting to photograph the victim in violation of §§ 18.2-27 and 18.2-386.1, not the completed crime; therefore, it was not necessary for the Commonwealth to prove that defendant, in fact, accomplished d irectly photographing the victim in the proscribed manner under the statute or that defendant actually photographed anything. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 53 Va. App. 599, 673 S.E.2d 923, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 137 (2009). Evidence, including four videos of naked, showering women found on defendants work computer, non-sequential segments indicating they had been taken out of ord er before stored, and storage of videos for over a year, supported a reasonable inference defendant knowingly and intentionally filmed the videos, supporting his convictions for intentionally videotaping nonconsenting persons aged 18 years or older. McCu rnin v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 293 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 21, 2017). Evidence sufficiently established that defendant engaged in the illegal filming of the minor victim because the filming was surreptitious with the camera being sl ipped under the victims closed bedroom door, the videos were found on defendants phone, defendant had access to the victims home as the victims parent was defendants paramour, and defendant seized and disabled the paramours phone to prevent the paramour from calling the police when the paramour confronted defendant about the videos that the paramour found on defendants phone. Blackwell v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. App. 30, 854 S.E.2d 191, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 29 (2021). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Multiple contemporaneous convictions required sex offender registration.  Defendant was required to register as a sex offender pursuant to subdivision B 1 of § 9.1-902 after he was convicted of nine violations of § 18.2-386.1 beca use he had accumulated at least three convictions of § 18.2-386.1 and the contemporaneousness of his convictions was not a bar to enforcement of the registration requirement. Commonwealth v. Schneider, 78 Va. Cir. 320, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 160 (Hanover County May 7, 2009). § 18.2-386.2. Unlawful dissemination or sale of images of another; penalty. Text A.

CASE NOTES Public place.  Public place comprises places and circumstances where an offender does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy because of the foreseeability of a non -consenting public witness, thus, the evidence supported defendants indecent exposure conviction. Defendant had no expectation of privacy when he masturbated while standing at the front bars of his cell, in open view of the staff, other inmates, and members of the public with authorized access. Barnes v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 495, 737 S.E.2d 919, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 65 (2013). Indecent exposure not lesser offense of sodomy.  Indecent exposure, though it may occur in almost all cases of sodomy where two persons are involved, is not a fact that must be charged or proved to sustain a con viction of sodomy in any case. Therefore, indecent exposure is not a lesser offense included in the offense of sodomy. Ashby v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 443, 158 S.E.2d 657, 1968 Va. LEXIS 130 (1968). But is lesser offense of exposure with lascivious intent.  While not a lesser offense included under sodomy because the facts to be proven are not the same, indecent exposure is a lesser offense included under the statuto ry felony of exposure to certain infants with lascivious intent, because only the intent differs. Hewitt v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 605, 194 S.E.2d 893, 1973 Va. LEXIS 193 (1973). Local governing bodies not prevented from enacting public nudity ordinances.  State laws do not prevent a local governing body, under its police power, from enacting public nudity ordinances not inconsistent with the state law prohibiting c onduct which the local governing body reasonably deems to be contrary to the morals, health, safety and general welfare of the community. Wayside Restaurant, Inc. v. City of Virginia Beach, 215 Va. 231, 208 S.E.2d 51, 1974 Va. LEXIS 264 (1974). Exposure of groin and buttocks clearly, fall within the proscriptions of this section. H art v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 77, 441 S.E.2d 706, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1091, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 152 (1994). Exposure of defendants penis violated the proscription of this section. Morales v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. App. 541, 525 S.E.2d 23, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 123 (2000 ). More than indecent exposure proven.  While defendant was correct in asserting that absent proof of lascivious intent, he could only be found guilty of misdemeanor indecent exposure, defendants co nduct in looking down at his groin and then adjusting his shorts so that his previously unexposed penis was exposed to two young girls riding by on bicycles involved sufficient conduct to show his lascivious intent and support his taking indecent liberti es with a child in violation of § 18.2-370. Viney v. Commonwealth, 269 Va. 296, 609 S.E.2d 26, 2005 Va. LEXIS 20 (2005). Indecent exposure not lesser offense of indecent liberties.  Indecent exposure, as proscribed by § 18.2-387, was not a lesser included offense of indecent liberties, as proscribed by § 18.2-370, because all the elemen ts of indecent exposure were not included in the offense charged, and, thus, failure to instruct the jury on indecent exposure was not error. Simon v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. App. 194, 708 S.E.2d 245, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 153 (2011). Evidence was clearly sufficient, etc. Evidence was clearly sufficient to support the trial courts conclusion that defendan ts exposure of his private parts was obscene, where defendant dropped his shorts in front of a clerk in an office supply store, so that he was clad in a skimpy G-string which covered only his penis and anus, leaving his pubic area and buttock s exposed; the trial court was entitled to conclude that defendants statements, in conjunction with his actions, clearly established that his actions had as their dominant purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex. Hart v. Commonwealth, 18 Va . App. 77, 441 S.E.2d 706, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1091, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 152 (1994). Evidence that defendant exposed his genitals, that he was clearly aroused, and that he was masturbating established that defendants actions had as their domin ant purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex and were therefore obscene. Copeland v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. App. 512, 525 S.E.2d 9, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 112 (2000). Proof that defendant was exposing his genitals, that he was in a visibly aroused state, and that he was masturbating satisfied the requirement that defendants conduct violated contemporary community standards of sexual candor. Morales v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. App. 541, 525 S.E.2d 23, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 123 (2000). Because a man masturbating in public could still display his person or private parts while not exposing his penis to sight, defendants public masturbation in front of children was an obscene display of his person or private parts even though he was fully clothed. Moses v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 357, 611 S.E.2d 607, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 220 (2005). Uncorroborated testimony supported defendants conviction for indecent exposure despite the victims delay in reporting the assault because the delay, which was due to the victims fear of her father, defendant, and her shame and embarrassment, was consistent with human experience and did not render her testimony inherently incredible. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 46 Va. App. 73, 615 S.E.2d 500, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 268 (2005). Evidence that defendant flaunted his almost completely nude body before an unsuspecting public in a very open public place, leaving his buttocks completely uncove red and his penis and scrotum covered by the thinnest strip of cloth, was sufficient to support defendants conviction for indecent exposure. Maness v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 191 (Va. Ct. App. May 20, 2014). Evidence insufficient.  Defendant was erroneously convicted of indecent exposure under § 18.2-387, where defendants conduct in exposing her breasts to three 11- and 12-year-old bo ys who were family friends was not obscene; defendants conduct was always done in a joking manner and defendant did not exhibit signs of sexual interest, such as visible arousal or masturbatory behavior. Neice v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 231 (Va. Ct. App. June 8, 2010). Although defendants behavior was inappropriate, it did not rise to the level of obscenity required under § 18.2-387, as defined in § 18.2-372, and defen dants conviction of indecent exposure was improper; nothing in the record suggested that defendant invited any sexual conduct with the victim, hinted at any sexual excitement on defendants part, or, when defendant dropped defendants pants upo n exiting a bus (with defendants back to the victim and running away from the victim), displayed defendants sexual organs to the victim or to anyone else. A. M. v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 46 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 12, 2013). Evidence that defendant was in a car in a parking lot, wearing only a womans nightgown with his genitals exposed, was insufficient to convict him of indecent exposure, as he did not admit to having an obscene intent, he was not visibly aroused, there was no evidence that he had been masturbating, and the totality of the circumstances did not support an inference that his dominant purpose was a prurient intere st in sex. Romick v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 336 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 19, 2013). Harmless error.  Despite a trial court expressing uncertainty as to whether the applicable standard was one of indecency or one of obscenity, any error was harmless because the ve rdict convicting defendant would have been the same as a result of defendants conduct of exposing his buttocks and breasts (he was a transvestite), in the early morning hours, on a street known for illegal prostitution, which was conduct that was int entional and done with the purpose of appealing to the prurient interest in sex. Willis v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 58 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 8, 2005). Intent not established.  While the evidence amply established that defendant exposed his private parts while standing at his bedroom window, the Commonwealth failed to bear its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the exposure was intentional. Stiftar v. Commonwealth, No. 0431-87-4 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 6, 1988). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Public place.  A jail may be a public place, provided the conduct in question occurs in an area of the jail or under circumstances where an inmate does not have a reason able expectation of privacy due to the foreseeability of a non-consenting public witness. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Robert J. McCabe, Sheriff, City of Norfolk, 16-025, 2016 Va. AG LEXIS 27 (11/10/16). § 18.2-387.1. Obscene sexual display; penalty.

CASE NOTES Arrest for viola tion of this section is authorized.  Under the plain language of this section, an officer is authorized to arrest a public inebriate. Carrasquillo v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 274 (Va. Ct. Ap p. May 22, 2001). Intoxication on private property shielded from public view not grounds for arrest.  Police officers did not have the right to arrest an individual for public intoxication where it was clearly established at the time of the arrest that by consumin g alcohol in his own yard, shielded from public view, at the end of a private road, the individual arrested did not commit the offense of public intoxication within the meaning of Virginia law. Rogers v. Pendleton, 249 F.3d 279, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 8157 (4th Cir. 2001). The plain meaning of in public for purposes of § 18.2-388 was a place in open view, visible to the community, and could include a defendants private property. Crislip v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 66, 554 S.E.2d 96, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 592 (2001). Defendant should not have been arrested absent physical impairment.  Granting of a defendants motion to suppress evidence in the form of a gun seized from his person and statements made to officers, where the officers lacked su fficient justification under the Fourth Amendment to perform a Terry v. Ohio stop, and to arrest and search defendant based on an uncorroborated anonymous tip, and where defendant admitted he had been drinking but was not intoxicated, was affirmed on app eal. United States v. Brown, 401 F.3d 588, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 4859 (4th Cir. 2005). Alcoholism is not a defense to a prosecution for public drunkenness. Rakes v. Coleman, 35 9 F. Supp. 370, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13329 (E.D. Va. 1973). A claim that it is cruel and unusual punishment to incarcerate an alcoholic without rehabilitation was not supported by the record. Rakes v. Coleman, 359 F. Supp. 370, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13329 (E.D. Va. 1973). When pending prosecutions may be enjoined.  A federal court may enjoin pending prosecutions for violation of this section only upon a showing of bad faith harassment by the state or abridgement of First Ame ndment freedoms in addition to a showing that the alleged injuries are immediate, real and irreparable. Rakes v. Coleman, 359 F. Supp. 370, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13329 (E.D. Va. 1973). Self-defense argument prohibited.  Defendants conviction for assault and battery of a law-enforcement officer was appropriate because the trial court did not err in refusing to accept defendant s self-defense argument. Whether the police had probable cause to arrest defendant for disorderly conduct was immaterial because police did have probable cause to arrest him for public intoxication under § 18.2-388; thus, the police officers were acting properly when they arrested defendant and he had no legal justification for head-butting a law-enforcement officer who was carrying out his lawful duties. Davis v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 209 (Va. Ct. App. May 18, 2010). As to standing of chronic alcoholics to seek declaratory relief on allegations of denial of defense of alcoholism and incarceration without rehabilitative treatment, see Rakes v. Coleman, 359 F. Supp. 370, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13329 (E.D. Va. 1973). Evidence held sufficient.  Evidence was sufficient to support a finding that officer possessed probable cause to believe that defendant was drunk in public where the officer testified that defendant slurred his speech and swayed from side to side, smelled of alcohol, and had bloodshot and glassy eyes; additionally, another witness testified that he saw defendant shortly after his arrest and also noticed that he slurred his speech, stumbled , and smelled of alcohol. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 322 (Va. Ct. App. May 28, 2002). Evidence supporting probation violation.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding defendant violated a condition of his probation prohibiting him from consuming alcoholic beverages to the exte nt that they disrupted or interfered with his employment or orderly conduct because although at the revocation hearing, he pleaded not guilty to the violation and argued that his drinking did not impact his employment or behavior, his drunk-in-public con viction provided the court evidence to the contrary. Because there was no abuse of discretion in the trial courts conclusion that defendant was guilty of violating a condition of his probation, there was no error in its decision to revoke and reimpos e his suspended sentences and to resuspend all but one year of those sentences. Turner v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 341 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 2, 2022). Probable cause to arrest.  Because defendants initial arrest for being drunk in public under § 18.2-388 was supported by probable cause, defendant had no right to resist; consequentl y, defendant was properly convicted of assault and battery of a police officer under § 18.2-57 when defendant later fled and then struggled with and injured a police officer. Brower v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 83 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2008). As defendants bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, unsteadiness on his feet, and possession of an open can of beer in a truck parked at a motel parking lot gave an officer probable cause to arrest him for public drunkenness under § 18.2-388, drugs found in a search of defendants pockets were admissible as the fruits of a search incident to an arrest. Whether the officer exceeded the permissible scope of a w eapons frisk, whether he believed he had probable cause to arrest defendant before the search, and the fact that he performed the search before the arrest were irrelevant. Commonwealth v. Lasley, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 10 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 13, 2009). Although there was a compelling argument that § 18.2-388, which criminalized cursing at an officer, was unconstitutional, plaintiff arrestee failed to show tha t it was so grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that defendant police officer should have anticipated its invalidation, thus, the arrest of the arrestee for calling the officer a bitch was supported by probable cause and the arrestees First and F ourth Amendment claims failed. Harrison v. Deane, 426 Fed. Appx. 175, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 8873 (4th Cir. 2011). Search incident to arrest for public drunkenness.  Cocaine found on defendant during a search incident to defendants arrest for public drunkenness was erroneously suppressed as a police officer had probable ca use to arrest defendant for public drunkenness under § 18.2-388, since defendant was found drunk and sleeping in a car in a parking lot open to the public and routinely used by apartment residents and guests; it did not matter for Fourth Amendment pur poses that defendant was charged under a City ordinance with a more narrow scope than the state public drunkenness statute. Commonwealth v. Carter, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 344 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 2007). Cocaine found in defendants vehicle was admissible because a police officer had probable cause under subsection B of § 19.2-81 to arrest defendant for publ ic intoxication, in violation of § 18.2-388, as the officer testified that as the officer approached defendants parked vehicle and spoke with defendant there was a very strong odor of alcohol coming from defendants breath, defendants speec h was slurred, and defendants eyes were very bloodshot. Furthermore, the officers search of defendants vehicle was a proper search incident to arrest under then existing law, as defendant was in custody and an occupant of the vehicle. McGhee v. Commonwealth, 280 Va. 620, 701 S.E.2d 58, 2010 Va. LEXIS 260 (2010). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL There is no statutory time limit within which a magistrate must grant bond for an intoxicated person charged with a misdemeanor offense, such as driving under the influence or public intoxication. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Gary W. Waters, Sheriff for the City of Portsmouth, 04-49 (7/15/04). Preliminary breath tests may be admissible.  The results of the preliminary breath tests (Alco-Sensor or like device) may be admissible for the offenses of underage possession of alcohol, possession or consu mption of alcoholic beverages by an interdicted person, and public intoxication at the discretion of t...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-389"><akn:num>§ 18.2-389</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 2004, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>462.

Ed. 2d 419 (1973) definition of obscenity, adapted for juveniles. Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 108 S. Ct. 636, 98 L. Ed. 2d 782, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 575 (1988). In defining harmful to juveniles in subdivision (6)(c), the General Assembly interpreted the statutory definition of harmful to juveniles in acco rdance with the current United States Supreme Court definition of obscenity. American Booksellers Ass'n v. Virginia, 882 F.2d 125, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 12234 (4th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1056, 110 S. Ct. 1525, 108 L. Ed. 2d 764, 1990 U.S. LEXI S 1607 (1990). Material depicting the lewd exhibition of a juveniles genitals is hard core obscenity for children. Freeman v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 301, 288 S.E.2d 461, 1982 Va. LEXIS 203 (1982). Photographing of exposed nipples, while within the literal definition of nudity under this section, is not, without more, the lewd exhibition of nudity required under § 18.2-374.1 as it read in 1979. Foster v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 313, 369 S.E.2d 688, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2867, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 55 (1988). Lewd exhibition of nudity.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of producing child pornography because, regardless of the fact that the child was clothed in Exhibit Six, the visual images were sexually explicit as they depicted lewd exhibitions of nudity by defendant because he filmed himself masturbating and ejaculating on the child; and defendants act of masturbating until he ejaculated on the child met statutory definitions of sexual excitement and sexual conduct. Ele v. Commonwealth, 70 Va. App. 543, 829 S.E.2d 564, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 162 (2019). Photographs considered sexua lly explicit.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of possession of child pornography; his photos of a nude 17-year-old girl were sexually explicit visual material  because they depicted her lying and sitting on a bed, a sexually suggestive setting, and showed her breasts and genitalia, and in view of his sexual relationship with her and the fact that he groped her breast while taking the photos, the jury could have inferred that he created the images with a lascivious intent. Phan Le v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 352 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 21, 2014). Books not shown to be ha rmful to juveniles.  Where none of the 16 books in question in a certification procedure met the third prong of the tripartite test established in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S. Ct. 1274 (1968), for determination of materials harmful to minors, none of the books was harmful to juveniles within the meaning of this section and § 18.2-391.

It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, rent or loan to a juvenile, knowing or having reason to know that such person is a juvenile, or to knowingly display for commercial purpose in a manner whereby juveniles may examine and peruse: 1.

Mobs, Riots an d Lynchings, § 1. CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Section 18.2-391, as amended by Acts 1999, c. 936, violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, because given the current state of Internet tec hnology, enforcement of the statute would restrict the access of both adults and children to material considered harmful to minors, and because the statute is not narrowly drawn. PSINet Inc. v. Chapman, 167 F. Supp. 2d 878, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16352 (W.D. Va. 2001), aff'd, 362 F.3d 227, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 5599 (4th Cir. 2004). Section 18.2-391, as amended by Acts 1999, c. 936, violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution because it is technologically infeasible for a W eb site operator to limit access to online materials by geographic location, and therefore, in order to avoid prosecution, an adult Web site operator must comply with the most restrictive state obscenity regulations if it is to make its content available on the Web at all. PSINet Inc. v. Chapman, 167 F. Supp. 2d 878, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16352 (W.D. Va. 2001), aff'd, 362 F.3d 227, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 5599 (4th Cir. 2004). Section 18.2-391 is unconstitutionally overbroad and violates the First Amendment; the district courts entry of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff busines ses, membership organizations, and individuals which entered a permanent injunction against the statute was upheld. Psinet, Inc. v. Chapman, 362 F.3d 227, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 5599 (4th Cir. 2004). Section 18.2-391 violates the Commerce Clause; given the broad reach of the Internet, it was difficult for the court to see how such a blanket regulation could be construed to have only a local effect. Psinet, Inc. v. Chapman, 362 F.3d 227, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 5599 (4th Cir. 2004). Injunction issued on basis of possible unconstitutionality.  Plaintiffs representing a spectrum of businesses, membership organizations and individuals who used the Internet to communicate, disseminate, display and to seek access to a broad range of speech were entitled to a preliminary injunction enjoining the enforcement of this section on the grounds that if no injunction issued, plaintiffs faced the choice of self-censorship or subjecting themselves to criminal liabili ty, that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits in that the statute in question was not narrowly tailored, did not provide the most effective means of preventing juveniles from viewing sexually explicit and harmful materials, and unduly burdened interstate commerce, and that it was in the public interest to prevent enforcement of an unconstitutional statute. PSINet, Inc. v. Chapman, 108 F. Supp. 2d 611, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11621 (W.D. Va. 2000). Virginia Codes current definition of harmful to juveniles is modification of Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973) definition of obscenity, adapted for juveniles. Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 108 S. Ct. 636, 98 L. Ed. 2d 782, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 575 (1988). Intent of 1985 amendment to su bsection (a).  The 1985 amendment to subsection (a) of this section, which added or to knowingly display for commercial purpose in a manner whereby juveniles may examine and peruse, is aimed not at the method chosen by the bookseller to display his wares for sale, but at the opportunity he may afford to juveniles to take off the shelves books which they are unable to buy, and to read them in the store.

United Steelworkers v. Dalton, 544 F. Supp. 282, 1982 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 9717 (E.D. Va. 1982). Language of this section closely follows common-law definition of unlawful assembly. Tha t definition requires the existence of circumstances evidencing a present threat of violence or breach of public order. United Steelworkers v. Dalton, 544 F. Supp. 282, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9717 (E.D. Va. 1982). States have right to maintain public order.  There is no doubt that the states retain the right to maintain public order. When clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic upon the p ublic streets, or other immediate threat to public safety, peace or order, appears, the power of the state to prevent or punish is obvious. This section does no more than exercise that power. United Steelworkers v. Dalton, 544 F. Supp. 282, 1982 U.S. Dis t. LEXIS 9717 (E.D. Va. 1982).

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Although this section can be applied to cause the removal from the streets of persons engaged in wholly lawful activities, that fact does not require a holding th at this section is unconstitutional on its face. United Steelworkers v. Dalton, 544 F. Supp. 282, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9717 (E.D. Va. 1982). Police must act quickly against clear and present danger.  When the public peace and order are in jeopardy, it is not unreasonable to authorize the police to clear the streets. This is not a long term measure. Once order is restored, those engaged in lawful activity may return to the streets. But at the time of a disturbance, or when there is a clear and present danger of an immediate disturbance, the Commonwealth requires that the police be able to take quick action. To require individual determinations of who is acting lawfully and who unlawfully would prove unduly burdensome. The ability of the police to restore order would be impaired; the restoration of order, unnecessarily slowed. United Steelworkers v. Dalton, 54 4 F. Supp. 282, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9717 (E.D.

To accomplish this end, the sheriff or other law-enforcement officer may request and use the assistance and services of private citizens. Every endeavor shall be used, both by such sheriff or other officers and by the officer commanding any other force, which can be made consistently with the preservation of life, to ind uce or force those unlawfully assembled to disperse before an attack is made upon those unlawfully assembled by which their lives may be endangered.

Willfully or while intoxicated, whether willfully or not, and whether such intoxication results from self-administered alcohol or other drug of whatever nature, disrupts the operation of any school or any activity conducted or sponsored by any school, if the disruption (i) prevents or interferes with the orderly conduct of the operation or activity or (ii) has a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person or persons at who m, individually, the disruption is directed.

Supp. 269, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7 234 (W.D. Va. 1974), aff'd, 516 F.2d 240, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 14614 (4th Cir. 1975). As to meaning of intoxicated, see Gardner v. Commonwealth, 195 Va. 945, 81 S.E.2 d 614, 1954 Va. LEXIS 172 (1954). Intent.  While defendants conduct demonstrated an intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm as required for a conviction of disorderly conduct under § 18.2-415, there was no evidence proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had an intention to prevent the officer from performing her duties, which is the conduct prohibited by § 18.2-460. Cary v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 295 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 20, 2015). This section applies, not only to disturbances which are made while the religious servic es are progressing, but also to disturbances made while the congregation is assembled for religious worship; though it be at night after the religious services are closed for the day, and the congregation has retired to rest. Commonwealth v. Jennings, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 624, 1846 Va. LEXIS 76 (1846). Disorderly conduct is not a lesser included offense of larceny. Cuthrell v. Zayre of Va., Inc., 214 Va. 427, 201 S.E.2d 779, 1974 Va. LEXIS 153 (1974). Charges of petit larceny and of disorderly conduct are two separate and distinct offenses, and a conviction of the one did not bar the conviction of the other. Cuthrell v. Zayre of Va., Inc., 214 Va. 427, 201 S.E.2d 779, 1974 Va. LEXIS 153 (1974). An indictment for disturbing a religious congregation need not set out the means by whic h the disturbance and disquieting was effected. Commonwealth v. Daniels, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 402 (1824). Lack of probable cause to arrest.  Because the police lacked probable cause to arrest defendant for either falsely summoning police or for disorderly conduct, the trial court erred in denying his m otion to suppress the drugs obtained from his arrest and defendants conviction for the possession of cocaine was improper. Thor v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 88 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 9, 2010). Conviction of diso rderly conduct was upheld, etc.  Conviction of disorderly conduct was upheld where evidence showed that defendant defied the police officers order to remain seated in his automobile while he prepared the traffic summons, jumped out, and became loud and uncooperative, refusing to calm down; such willful, intemperate and provocative conduct, in response to proper law enforcement activity, audible for several blocks and visible from a public street, clearly evinced the intent or recklessness contemplated by the ordinance. Keyes v. City of Va. Beach, 16 Va. App. 198, 428 S.E.2d 766, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1155, 1993 Va. A pp. LEXIS 86 (1993). Defendant was properly convicted for disorderly conduct at a county board of supervisors meeting where he persisted in inappropriate questioning, refused to leave the podium, disrupted the meeting, prevented the board from hearing the comments of other citizens, and forced the board to forcibly remove him from the room. Mannix v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. App. 271, 522 S.E.2d 885, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (2000). Defendant, upset about being ejected from the bar, got louder and abusive, and attracted a crowd; when officer warned the defendant he would be arrested for that behavior, the defendant started waving his arms around and continued yelling. Believing that the defendant was in the beginning stages of combative behavior and that he wanted to fight, the officer arrested the defendant. It was reasonable to infer from those facts that the defendant was not going to stop causing a scene until he was permitted to re-enter the premises, which he was not entitled to do. Jolinski v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 449 (Va. Ct. App. June 20, 2000). Defendants conviction of disorderly conduct under this section was supported by sufficient evidence, as defendants acts of taking pictures of the victims, the grandparents of defendants fiances children and others, created a risk of violence in instigating a confrontation between defendant and the childrens grandmother. Potter v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 98 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 12, 2002 ). Defendants conviction of disorderly conduct under § 18.2-415 was supported by sufficient evidence; the situs of the offense, a drug store, was a public pla ce as required by the statute, and defendants acts of threatening a store manager with physical violence after defendant was fired from his job at the store had a direct tendency to cause acts of violence. Williams v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXI S 689 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 19, 2002). Defendants conviction for disorderly conduct was affirmed where, when a police officer approached defendant, defendant became angry and loudly cursed the offi cer, repeatedly called the officer a bitch and said she did not have to do what the officer requested, attempted to evade the officer, and when the officer blocked defendants route of escape, defendant raised her cup above her shoulder and th rew the cup at the o...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-416"><akn:num>§ 18.2-416</akn:num><akn:heading>Punishment for using abusive language to another</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If any person shall, in the presence or hearing of another, curse or abuse such other person, or use any violent abusive language to such person concerning himself or a ny of his relations, or otherwise use such language, under circumstances reasonably calculated to provoke a breach of the peace, he shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.

CASE NOTES Application of this section is limited to words that have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is addressed. Mercer v. Winston, 214 Va. 281, 199 S.E.2d 724, 1973 Va. LEXIS 294 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 988, 94 S. Ct. 2393, 40 L. Ed. 2d 765, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 241 (1974). This section addresses itself to a direct confrontation of individuals in which one curses or abuses the other or uses violent abusive language concerning the oth er or his or her relations under circumstances which would precipitate an immediate, forceful and violent reaction by a reasonable person. It envisions words of a kind and nature spoken under such circumstances as by their utterance reasonably tend to pr ovoke a breach of the peace. Mercer v. Winston, 214 Va. 281, 199 S.E.2d 724, 1973 Va. LEXIS 294 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 988, 94 S. Ct. 2393, 40 L. Ed. 2d 765, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 241 (1974). In light of such construction this section is not constitutionally vague and overbroad u nder the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.Mercer v. Winston, 214 Va. 281, 199 S.E.2d 724, 1973 Va. LEXIS 294 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 988, 94 S. Ct. 2393, 40 L. Ed. 2d 765, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 241 (1974). This section serves a valid and proper purpose for it is aimed at preventing personal, f ace-to-face, abusive and insulting language likely to provoke a violent reaction and retaliation. Mercer v. Winston, 214 Va. 281, 199 S.E.2d 724, 1973 Va. LEXIS 294 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 988, 94 S. Ct. 2393, 40 L. Ed. 2d 765, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 241 (1974). Remarks designed to provoke violence.  Application of this section is limited to words that have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is addressed . Hershfield v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 381, 417 S.E.2d 876, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2867, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 301 (1992). A conviction under this section must be supported by evidence that abusive language is spoken to or about another in his presence or hearing and under circumstanc es reasonably calculated to provoke a breach of peace. Hershfield v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 381, 417 S.E.2d 876, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2867, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 301 (1992). Remarks not uttered in a face-to-face confrontation.  In the context of a private incident between two neighbors separated by a front yard and a fence, the language go f yourself was not uttered i n a face-to-face confrontation. Since parties were separated by at least 55 feet and by chain link fence, this was not likely to provoke a breach of peace. Hershfield v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 381, 417 S.E.2d 876, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2867, 1992 Va . App. LEXIS 301 (1992). In sulting words need not be used in presence of third person.  In order to constitute an offense under this section, the insulting words need not be used in the presence of some third person as well as in the presence of the person to or about whom they were spoken. The expression such person, in the section refers to the person in the presence or hearing of whom the insult is offered; and the offense is complete whenever insulting language is spoken to or ab out another, or about his female relations, in his presence and under circumstances reasonably calculated to provoke a breach of the peace, regardless of the presence or absence of third persons. Byrd v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 833, 98 S.E. 632, 1919 Va. L EXIS 171 (1919). Evidence of truth is admissible in mitigation of punishment.  In a prosecution under this section, evidence that the offense words spoken were true was held not admissible in bar of the prosecution, but admissible in mitigat ion of the punishment. Byrd v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 833, 98 S.E. 632, 1919 Va. LEXIS 171 (1919). While in many cases the insulting words spoken to or in the presence of another about his female relations, may be of such a character as that their truth would n ot be accorded very much, if any, weight in mitigation of the offense; yet such evidence should be received for what it is worth as an aid in fixing the punishment. Byrd v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 833, 98 S.E. 632, 1919 Va. LEXIS 171 (1919). And rejection is not harmless error.  In a prosecution under this section error in rejecting evidence of the truth of the insulting words offered in mitigation of the punishment was not harmless where the amount of the fine imposed was materially larger than the minimum fixed by the statute. Byrd v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 833, 98 S.E. 632, 1919 Va. LEXIS 171 (1919). Fighting words is jury question.  If the unlawful conduct relied upon consists of the use by a defendant of violent abusive language to another, it is for the jury to determine whether the words u sed are fighting words and whether the use of such words under the circumstances are reasonably calculated to provoke a violent reaction and retaliation. If so, their utterance constitutes an offense under this section. Mercer v. Winston, 214 Va. 281, 199 S.E.2d 724, 1973 Va. LEXIS 294 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 988, 94 S. Ct. 2393, 40 L. Ed. 2d 765, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 241 (1974). Venue must be established.  In a prosecution under this section, the Commonwealth is bound to establish the venue, and, regardless of instructions, if there is no proof at all as to where th e offense was committed, the verdict of guilty should be set aside and a new trial awarded. Byrd v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 833, 98 S.E. 632, 1919 Va.

Acts 2020, c. 900, cl. 3 provides: That the provisions of this act may result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment or commitment. Pursuant to § 30- 19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined for periods of imprisonment in state adult correctional facilities; therefore, Chapter 854 of the Acts of Assembly of 2019 requires the Virginia Crim inal Sentencing Commission to assign a minimum fiscal impact of $50,000. Pursuant to § 30-19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined for periods of commitment to the custody of the Departme nt of Juvenile Justice. The 2020 amendments. The 2020 amendment by c. 900, in the first paragraph, substituted concerning any person, such persons, such person and to any pers on for concerning any female, such females, such female and to any female, respectively, and substituted or who shall use for or shall use and is guilty for shall be guilty. Law Review.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Actionable words.  Words that falsely speak towards a womans chastity and character are actionable as defamation in Virginia, under § 18.2-417; the words slut, wh ore, prostitute, and bitch fit this meaning under the Virginia Code. Magallon v. Wireless Unlimited Inc., 85 Va. Cir. 460, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 98 (Fairfax County Oct. 23, 2012). Defamation claim properly pleaded.  Employee claimed that an account manager called her a slut, bitch, whore, and prostitute, and her complaint also contained phrases including bitch, I (expleti ve) fired you, and bitch, get away from the store or I am going to call the police, which might infer that the employee had been fired for a criminal offense, which inference could harm her reputation and be prejudicial to her; the employee s complaint properly pleaded a claim for defamation for the managers actions, for which the business might be held liable.

In 28 U.S.C.S. § 2254 action, federal district court held this section constitutional. Virginias mask-wearing prohibition did not violate the First nor Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech, due process, and equal protection as applied to habeas petitioner, a Ku Klux Klan member. Hernandez v. Superintendent, Fredericks burg-Rappahannock Joint Sec. Ctr., 800 F. Supp. 1344, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13607 (E.D. Va. 1992). Section held constitutional as applied to member of Ku Klux Klan.  This section was not unconstitutional as applied to a Ku Klux Klan member who, in addition to the Klans traditional white robe and hood, wore a mask covering his entire face except for his eyes. Hernandez v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 669, 406 S.E.2d 398, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2935, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 140 (1991), . Klan hood no t entitled to First Amendment protection.  Ku Klux Klan members mask-wearing did not constitute expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection because it did not convey a particularized mess age.

Requisite intent to conceal identity.  The words so as to conceal the identity express a requirement of intent; therefore, to violate this section, an individual must intend to conceal his iden tity by covering his face. Hernandez v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 669, 406 S.E.2d 398, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2935, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 140 (1991), . Actions not prohibited by section.  This section does not prohibit the masking of ones face for a purpose other than concealing ones identity, such as protection from cold weather, expressio n of grief, or practice of a religion.

Evidence sufficiently supported defendants conviction for wearing a mask in a public place, etc. Evidence sufficiently supported defendants conviction for wearing a mask in a public place where police officer testified he saw defendant with his face covered by a mask in parking lot of a convenience store which was open to the public for business. Hopson v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 749, 427 S.E.2d 221, 9 Va. Law Rep. 899, 19 93 Va. App. LEXIS 39 (1993), overruled in part, Jones v. Commonwealth, 70 Va. App. 307, 826 S.E.2d 908, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (2019). Trial court properly found that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of feloniously wearing a mask because it did not err when it relied only on its o wn observations of defendants physical appearance to determine that there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was over the age of sixteen when he committed the offense; the court of appeals had to give deference to the trial courts finding regarding defendants age. Stith v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. App. 27, 773 S.E.2d 165, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 212 (2015). The evidence was sufficient to support a defendants conviction under this section where a participant in a robbery identified the defendant and stated that th e defendant was wearing a mask when the crime was committed and where an employee of the theatre that was robbed testified that all three men involved in the crime were wearing masks and carrying guns. Kingsberry v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 622 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 22, 2000). See Young v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 588 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 12, 2003). Evidence was sufficient to support a jurys verdict convicting defendant of robbery, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, § 18.2-53.1, and wearin g a mask in public, § 18.2-422, under circumstances in which defendant did not contest the victims testimony that a robbery occurred, defendant and another individual were identified when the victims purse was found in a creek near the other i ndividuals residence and the other individuals fingerprint was found on the victims credit card still inside the purse, when the other individual was arrested, defendant was with him, and, in a subsequent videotaped confession, defendant told a detective that he was the robber and gave numerous specific details about the offense, his subsequent flight from the scene, and the disposal of the purse in the creek; defendant admitted wearing a mask and using a BB gun to commit the offense. Defend ants actions did not support his claim that he confessed to prevent the other individual from being held responsible for the robbery. Sears v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 319 (Va. Ct. App. July 14, 2009). Although no witness was able to identify defendant by facial recognition, as the robber was wearing a mask during the robbery, there was sufficient evidence to co nvict defendant of unlawfully wearing a mask during a robbery where the surveillance camera photographs showed the robber wearing a dark, hooded jacket or sweatshirt of some type, with a tag or label on the lower left front side, as well as distinctively marked gloves, the store owner testified that defendants height was about the same as the height of the robber and the robber was African-American, as was defendant, a police officer later encountered defendant wearing a dark jacket, zipped up, with a knit cap on his head and the hood of his jacket pulled over his head, with a tag or label on the lower left front side, and the officer discovered a pair of gloves and a handgun lying on the ground in a haphazard fashion, as if someone had quickly or carelessly tossed them there, defendants DNA profile was consistent with that found on the gloves, and the gloves had the same color and distinctive markings as the gloves worn by the robber. Spence v. Commonwealth, 60 Va. App. 355, 727 S.E.2d 786, 2 012 Va. App. LEXIS 221 (2012). Evidence was sufficient to find that defendant was involved in a home invasion, which led to convictions for armed burglary, attempted robbery, and wearing a mask in public because, about 40 minutes after the victim fired two shots at intruders, defendant and codefendant arrived with gunshot wounds at a hospital located about 40 minutes away; both men claimed that they were together at a house party when they were shot, but they could not provide details to police to confirm their story; cell phone records suggested that both men were near the victims residence when the home invasion occurred; and codefendant was shot with the same kind of unusual ammuni tion that the victim used during the home invasion. Chantz v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 44 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 21, 2017). Sufficient evidence of principal in the second degree.  Where evidence clearly showed that defendant shared co-defendants criminal intent; committed an overt act in furtherance of their plans when he supplied mask to co-defendant so that co-defendant could not be identified; and then in a vehicle the defendant controlled, drove co-defendant to the places where the crimes were committed, evidence supported the trial court findings that defendant was guilty as a pri ncipal in the second degree of three violations of this section. McGill v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 728, 485 S.E.2d 173, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 321 (1997).

Rev. 133 (2004). Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 4C M.J. Constitutional Law, § 78. CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Section 18.2-423 violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, because it is impermissible to punish intimidation based solely upon the content of otherwise protected symbolic speech, and because the statute is overbroad in that it permits arrest and prosecution for both protected and unprotected speech. Black v. Commonwealth, 262 Va. 764, 553 S.E.2d 738, 2001 Va. LEXIS 144 (2001), aff'd in part , vacated in part, 538 U.S. 343, 123 S. Ct. 1536, 155 L. Ed. 2d 535, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 2715 (2003). Statutory prohibition of cross burning with the intent to intimidate does not violate the right to freedom of speech, since the statute bans intentional intimidat ing conduct rather than expression. Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 123 S. Ct. 1536, 155 L. Ed. 2d 535, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 2715 (2003). On remand from the United States Supreme Court, the court declined to interpret a model jury instruction to save the prima facie evidence provision of § 18.2-4 23 from unconstitutionality because the instruction, taken in context of the other instructions, properly interpreted the provision. Thus, the court affirmed its prior holding that the prima facie evidence provision of § 18.2-423 was unconstitutionall y overbroad because of its chilling effect upon the exercise of free speech under the First Amendment. Elliott v. Commonwealth, 267 Va. 464, 593 S.E.2d 263, 2004 Va. LEXIS 41 (2004). Because Va. Const., art. I, § 12, was coextensive with the First Amendments free speech provisions, after severance of the provision concerning prima facie evidence of intent, § 18.2-423 did not violate the First Amendment or Va. Const., art. I, § 12. Elliott v. Commonwealth, 267 Va. 464, 593 S.E.2d 263, 2004 Va. LEXIS 41 (2004). Severability of prim a facie evidence provision.  Because § 18.2-423 did not fall within either of the exceptions to the rule of severability established in § 1-17.1 [see now § 1-243], the court held tha t the statute was severable and that the provisions of the statute that remained did not violate the First Amendment or Va. Const., art. I, § 12. Elliott v. Commonwealth, 267 Va. 464, 593 S.E.2d 263, 2004 Va. LEXIS 41 (2004). § 18.2-423.01.

Displaying noose on property of another or a highway or other public place with intent to intimidate; penalty. Text A. Any person who, with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons, displays a noose on the private property of another without permission is guilty of a Class 6 felony. B. Any person who, with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons, displays a noose on a highway or other public place in a manner having a direct tendency to place another person in reasonable fear or apprehension of death or bodily injury is guilty o f a Class 6 felony. History History. 2009, c. 277. Annotations CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Statute did not offend the First Amendment because (1) the display of a noose evoked a long history of impending violence, (2) the statute had no prima facie evid ence provision found unconstitutional in a similar statute, and (3) the statute only barred true threats, as the Commonwealth had to prove another was put in reasonable fear of death or injury. Turner v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 46, 792 S.E.2d 299, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 316 (2016). Display on private property.  Defendants display of a noose on defendants property violated the statute because (1) barring a display in a public place did not mean public prop erty, (2) the noose conveyed an offensive message and disturbed those within the nooses view, (3) the statute barred displays communicating true threats, and (4) using the Virginia Supreme Courts prior definition of public place to include conduc t on ones premises disturbing those within the conducts view furthered the legislative purpose when accompanied by an intent to intimidate and tendency to cause reasonable fear of death or injury. Turner v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 46, 792 S.E.2 d 299, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 316 (2016). Court of Appeals of Virginia applies the obvious and rational meaning of the term public place as used in subsection B to include private property generally visib le by the public from some other location. Turner v. Commonwealth, 295 Va. 104, 809 S.E.2d 679, 2018 Va. LEXIS 12, cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 123, 202 L. Ed. 2d 77, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 5611 (2018). Because the Court of Appeals of Virginia presumes that the word place under subsection B means something different than the word property under subsection A, the term public place under subsection B is not limited in scope to public property, a term nowhere found in the statute. In other words, under subsection B, whether a noose display is on privately or publicly owned property is not determinative of whether i t is located on a public place. Turner v. Commonwealth, 295 Va. 104, 809 S.E.2d 679, 2018 Va. LEXIS 12, cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 123, 202 L. Ed. 2d 77, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 5611 (2018). Defendants noose display located in his front yard and clearly visible from a public road unmistakably fell within the purview of the subsection B element pro scribing a noose display on a public place where the obvious and rational meaning of the term public place included private property generally visible by the public from some other location. Turner v. Commonwealth, 295 Va. 104, 809 S.E.2d 679, 20 18 Va. LEXIS 12, cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 123, 202 L. Ed. 2d 77, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 5611 (2018). Article 6.

CASE NOTES Section as it stood prior to 1975 and 1976 amendments held facially overbr oad and impermissibly sweeping.  See Walker v. Dillard, 523 F.2d 3, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 13757 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 906, 96 S. Ct. 208, 46 L. Ed. 2d 136, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 3008 (1975) . Section is not overbroad.  This section is not overbroad because it can be construed so that the phrase with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass applies to the words that it directly follows and also applies to the use of obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language. Perkins v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 7, 402 S.E.2d 229, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1846, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1991). In view of the legislatures amendments to the statute following the decision in Walk er v. Dillard, 523 F.2d 3 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 906, 96 S. Ct. 208, 46 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1975), the legislature intended to address harassing conduct as the evil to be p roscribed and intended to narrow the scope of the speech phrases to that which is obscene. This construction is not strained and removes protected speech from within the statutes sweep. Perkins v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 7, 402 S.E.2d 229, 7 Va. La w Rep. 1846, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1991). Section is not void for vagueness.  By requiring that the language be used with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass, the statute gives a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited. The police cannot make arbitrary arrests under the statute. By requiring a criminal mens rea, any alleged vagueness has been remedied. Perkins v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 7, 402 S.E.2d 229, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1846, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1991). Words vulgar, profane and indecent are capable of overbroad inte rpretation. Walker v. Dillard, 523 F.2d 3, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 13757 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 906, 96 S. Ct. 208, 46 L. Ed. 2d 136, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 3008 (1975) (decided prior to the 1975 and 1976 amendments to this section). Words like vulgar, profane and indecent have sometimes been interpreted as meaning obscene, but only when they have been used in c onjunction with other, more specific adjectives like obscene, lewd and lascivious. Walker v. Dillard, 523 F.2d 3, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 13757 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 906, 96 S. Ct. 208, 46 L. Ed. 2d 136, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 3008 (1975) (decided prior to the 1975 and 1976 amendments to this section). Threat must be narrowly defined in order to avoid punishing constitutionally pro tected speech. Walker v. Dillard, 523 F.2d 3, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 13757 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 906, 96 S. Ct. 208, 46 L. Ed. 2d 136, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 3008 (1975) (decided prior to the 1975 and 1976 amendments to this section). As the correct interpretation of defendants voicemail statements had to be determined by the jury, based on whether a reasonable recipient would interpret def endants remarks as threats, defendants conviction for making threatening/obscene phone calls was proper. Alexander v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 137 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 30, 2013), aff'd, No. 130807, 2014 Va. Unpub. LEXIS 27 (Va. Feb. 14, 20 14). State has a legitimate interest in prohibiting obscene, threatening and harassing phone calls, none of which are generally thought of as protected by the First Amendment. Walker v. Dillard, 523 F.2d 3, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 13757 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 906, 96 S. Ct. 208, 46 L. Ed. 2d 136, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 3008 (1975) (decided pri or to the 1975 and 1976 amendments to this section). Proscription of section must not be one that unduly impinges on protected expression. Wal ker v. Dillard, 523 F.2d 3, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 13757 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 906, 96 S. Ct. 208, 46 L. Ed. 2d 136, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 3008 (1975) (decided prior to the 1975 and 1976 amendments to this section). Use of expert testimony to explain caller identification device was not necessary to Com monwealths case. The user of the caller identification device could testify as to facts establishing the reliability of the device, including that it had accurately displayed and identified telephone numbers on other occasions. Blackstone v. Commonwe alth, No. 1077-96-3 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 7, 1997). No error in allowing manager for telephone company to testify.  Trial judge did not err in allowing regional security manager for telephone company to testify where he did not know the type of caller identification device used and claimed no expertise as to the operation of such devices. Although manager did not claim to be an expert, he had knowledge and personal experience with caller identification devices. On this record, the trial judge did abuse his discretion in conclu ding that manager had sufficient knowledge of this matter to give value to his opinion. Blackstone v. Commonwealth, No. 1077-96-3 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 7, 1997). While defendant used words which could be obscene in certain contexts, defendant used the offensive words as vulgar curse or swear words to communicate his frustr ation, anger, contempt or disgust with the victim. Accordingly, defendants language failed to meet the definition of obscene as required by case law and § 18.2-372 and defendants conviction under § 18.2-427 was reversed. Lofgren v. Commonwe alth, 55 Va. App. 116, 684 S.E.2d 223, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 491 (2009). Sufficient evidence of violation.  Statement to school personnel officer by employee facing termination that I have some fireworks for you followed by a statement that I am going to bri ng all three down, supported the finding of the trial court that appellant violated this section. Witts v. Commonwealth, No. 0078-94-1 (Ct. of Appeals April 4, 1995). Defendant was properly convicted of violating former § 18.2-427 by leaving threatening messages on the victims answering machine because (1) defendants language was sufficient to enable a rational fact-finder to conclude defendant threatened the victim with physical injury in the form of a sexual offense, with the obvious intent to intimidate and harass the victim, (2) such speech fell outside the prot ection of the First Amendment, so state law could proscribe the language, obscene or not, and (3) whether the language was obscene was immaterial, since the statutory offense of threatening illegal or immoral acts was not qualified by the word obscen e. Rives v. Commonwealth, 284 Va. 1, 726 S.E.2d 248, 2012 Va. LEXIS 126 (2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1163, 133 S. Ct. 1294, 185 L. Ed. 2d 187, 2013 U.S. LEXIS 1182 (2013). Admission of call trap evidence.  Results of a call trap, which is an electronic device programmed into the telephone companys computer to trace calls, may be admitted only after the particula r device in question has been proven reliable. Penny v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 494, 370 S.E.2d 314, 5 Va. Law Rep. 30, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 68 (1988). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Expungement improper.  Entering of an order of expungement was improper because, having pleaded guilty to the use of profane language removed defendant from the group of innocent citize ns the legislature envisioned as being eligible for expungement; had the incident giving rise to the stalking charge and subsequent conviction of use of profane language been otherwise dismissed, the result would have left defendant as an innocent citize n with a record of the charge being a hindrance to his ability to obtain employment, an education, and to obtain credit. Defendant was not an innocent citizen in regard to the stalking charge and subsequent guilty plea to use of profane language over a t elephone. Commonwealth v. Rowe, 85 Va. Cir. 323, 2012 Va. Cir.

CASE NOTES Intent must exist when call is made.  Defendants conviction for misuse of the 9-1-1 system was reversed because the evidence failed to establish that defendant possessed the requisite intent to an noy, harass, hinder or delay emergency personnel in the performance of their duties at the time she caused the telephone to ring; and her intent to intimidate the officers, which developed after she remained on the telephone, did not violate the statute as an intent to annoy, harass, hinder or delay that arose during the call did not fall within the scope of the statutory prohibition.

Lewis v. Commonw ealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 414 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2012). Evidence sufficient.  Defendants convictions for possession of a cell phone by a prisoner was supported by sufficient evidence as, in the first instance, the evidence showed that d efendant handed the cell phone to the correctional officer, establishing that he had actual possession of the phone. With regard to the second conviction, the evidence that defendant was lying on the cot moments before the officer searched the cell and t hat the phone could be easily felt from the outside of the mattress supported the trial courts finding that defendant constructively possessed the phone. Lewis v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 414 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2012). Affirmative testimony from two officers that the phone seized from defendant while he was in jail was a cellular phone was sufficient to support defendants co nviction for possession of a cellular telephone by a prisoner, as defendant did not object to the testimony and conceded that one of the officers got him, which was evidence of consciousness of guilt. Ragland v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 519, 797 S.E.2d 437, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 87 (2017). Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of possession of a cellular telephone by a prisoner because defendant was seen hiding an item in his prison cell; thr ee correctional officers identified the item as a cell phone, and one officer testified that it was similar to cell phones he had previously recovered during prison searches; contemporaneous photographs and the item itself were admitted into evidence; an d the Commonwealth was not required to produce expert testimony to identify the item as a cell phone nor demonstrate functionality or operability.

The 2003 amendment by c. 976 rewrote the definition of Firearm, which formerly read:  Firearm means any weapon which is designed to or may rea dily be converted to expel any projectile by the action of an explosive; or the frame or receiver of any such weapon. The 2004 amendments.

Breach of the Peace, § 2; 20 M.J. Weapons, § 4.1. § 18.2-433.2. Paramilitary activity prohibited; penalty. Text A. A person is guilty of unlawful paramilitary activity, punishable as a Class 5 felony, if he: 1. Teach es or demonstrates to any other person the use, application, or making of any firearm, explosive or incendiary device, or technique capable of causing injury or death to persons, knowing or having reason to know or intending that such training will be em ployed for use in, or in furtherance of, a civil disorder; 2.

Acts 2020, c. 601, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act may result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment or commitment. Pursuant to § 30- 19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined for periods of imprisonment in state adult correctional facilities; therefore, Chapter 854 of the Acts of Assembly of 2019 requires the Virginia Crim inal Sentencing Commission to assign a minimum fiscal impact of $50,000.

CASE NOTES Fifth amendment does not shield pe rjury.  Although the amendment grants a privilege to remain silent without risking contempt, it does not endow the person who testifies with a license to commit perjury. The warnings simply inform the witness that the privilege is available in order to eliminate the dilemma of self-incrimination or perjury. Shifflett v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 277, 361 S.E.2d 783, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1049, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 240 (1987). Failure to give fifth amendment warnings is not defense to perjury charge. Shifflett v. C ommonwealth, 5 Va. App. 277, 361 S.E.2d 783, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1049, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 240 (1987). Statements made in suppression hearing in prosecution of another.  Defendants incriminating statements made at a suppression hearing in the prosecution of another person were constitutionally admissible as evidence against hi m at his trial for perjury. Because the crime of perjury had not yet been committed at the time defendant took the stand and began to testify at the suppression hearing, his sixth amendment right to counsel did not attach as to that charge. Therefore, th e evidence obtained during his testimony was not required to be excluded simply because other charges were pending at that time. Shifflett v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 277, 361 S.E.2d 783, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1049, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 240 (1987). Failure to include words not fatal.  Trial court did not err in refusing to quash indictment because it failed to specifically include words any material matter  contained in this section sin ce body of indictment contained words in violation of Code § 18.2-434,  and thus, appellant was fully informed of charge he was required to defend. Tomlinson v. Commonwealth, No. 0798-87-2 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 7, 1989). Two wi tnesses or other corroborating evidence required.  A perjury conviction under this section requires proof of falsity from the testimony of at least two witnesses or other corroborating evidence of falsity in the e vent the case is supported by the testimony of only one witness. Donowa v. Commonwealth, No. 1579-95-2 (Ct. of Appeals May 28, 1996). The law as stated in Schwartz v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 1025 (1876) remains in effect, and a perjury conviction under this section requires proof of fal sity from the testimony of at least two witnesses or other corroborating evidence of falsity in the event the case is supported by the testimony of only one witness. Keffer v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 545, 404 S.E.2d 745, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2670, 1991 Va. A pp. LEXIS 110 (1991). Videotape evidence a lone sufficient to convict.  Defendants perjury conviction for denying under oath that he had masturbated in a public place was affirmed, as a videotape of him performing the act spoke fo r itself, and the Schwartz rules requirement of corroborating testimony was inapplicable. Piatkowski v. Ralph D. Kaiser Co., 219 Va. 1015, 254 S.E.2d 68, 1979 Va. LEXIS 204 (1979). This section is to be construed strictly as a penal statute. Commonwealth v. Simon, 11 V a. L. Reg. 349 (1925). Oath must be lawfully administered.  By this section any occasion  suffices, but it is required that the oath shall be lawfully administered. Thus where there was no requirement or provision of law for a notarys administering the oath of loss of an automobile for the purpose of collecting on an insurance policy, and as under § 49-4 the notary was only authorized to take such affidavits as are required by law, such an affidavit was not lawfully administered as required by this section. Commonwealth v. Simon, 11 Va. L. Reg. 349 (1925). Where the court which administered an oath had no jurisdiction to do so, one who swore falsely before it was not guilty of perjury. Commonwealth v. Calvert, 3 Va. (1 Va. Cas.) 265 (1809). Oath must be willful and false.  To constitute the crime of perjury, the oath must have been willful and false. Falsity is the main ingredient of the crime. Thomas v. Commonwealth, 41 Va. (2 Rob. ) 795, 1843 Va. LEXIS 58 (1843); Fitch v. Commonwealth, 92 Va. 824, 24 S.E. 272, 1896 Va. LEXIS 43 (1896). It does not apply to gratuitous affidavit.  A gratuitous affidavit, that is, one unprovided for or unauthorized by law, though false, does not fall within the requirements of this section as being a n oath lawfully administered on any occasion . . . touching any material matter or thing,  so as to constitute a perjury. Commonwealth v. Simon, 11 Va. L. Reg. 349 (1925). Knowledge of falsity must be proved.  Perjury can only be established upon proof of knowledge of falsity of the alleged statements. It cannot be predicated where wilfulness and corruption are not prov en. Rothfuss v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 461, 94 S.E.2d 532, 1956 Va. LEXIS 230 (1956). And false statement must be material.  To convict one of perjury, the alleged false statement must have been material in the judicial proceeding in which it is proved to have been made. Commonwealth v. Pickering, 49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 628, 1851 Va. LEXIS 75 (1851), overruled, Fitch v. Commonwealth, 92 Va. 824, 24 S.E. 272, 1896 Va. LEXIS 43 (1896); Crump v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. 922, 1882 Va. LEXIS 2 (1882); Rhodes v. Commonwealth, 78 Va. 692, 1884 Va. LEX IS 42 (1884) (see also Fitch v. Commonwealth, 92 Va. 824, 24 S.E. 272 (1896); Commonwealth v. Roach, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 561 (1844)). Where person makes false statements under oath regarding a material fact, he can be prosecuted for perjury for the false statement. Ganzie v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 422, 482 S.E.2d 863, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 164 (1997). R. swore that M. had stolen bacon and offered to sell it to him on November 15th, 1875. Later, R. swore that M. had stolen bacon and offered to sell it to him jus t before Christmas, 1875. On indictment against R. for perjury, it was not proved that M. did not steal bacon, but it was proved that R. made contradictory statements as to the date. R. was convicted. It was held that the stealing of the bacon was the ma terial matter of the charge; that the date of the offer to sell was not material to the offense; that the oath as to the date was not material to the issue, and was not likely to induce the jury to give the readier credit to the substantial part of the e vidence; and that R. was not guilty of perjury. Rhodes v. Commonwealth, 78 Va. 692, 1884 Va. LEXIS 42 (1884). If the untrue representation does not touch any material matter or thing in the trial, the mere falsity of the statement alone will not sustain a perjury convicti on. The testimony must be relevant in the trial of the case, either to the main issue or some collateral issue. Holz v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 876, 263 S.E.2d 426, 1980 Va. LEXIS 179 (1980). Defendants perjury conviction was not upheld where the inquiry to which defendant falsely swore was not material to a proper matter of inquiry. Trotman v. Com monwealth, 10 Va. App. 403, 392 S.E.2d 685, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2431, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 101 (1990).

Upon the trial on such indictment, it shall be sufficient to prove that the defendant, knowingly and with the i ntent to testify falsely, gave such differing testimony and that the differing testimony was given on two separate occasions.

CASE NOTES The term, give testimony, as used in this section encompasses any material decla ration made under oath, whether ex parte or in an adversary proceeding subject to cross-examination. Scott v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 294, 416 S.E.2d 47, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2621, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 117 (1992). Burden to show tha t testimony was not conflicting.  Where the defendant testified at a criminal proceeding that he could not read, but subsequently denied at a child custody hearing that he had testified as such, the defendant bore the burden of producing some evidence to show that his testimony was not conflicting. Henson, Jr. v. Commonwealth, No. 1741-97-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 22, 1998). Knowing use of perjured testimony.  Although witness testimony at defendants trial partially conflicted with the testimony he gave at a co-defendants trial, there was no evidence indicat ing the witness gave partially conflicting testimony with the intent to testify falsely, that the witness had any prior negative association with defendant, or had any other motive to testify falsely at defendants trial, thus defendants claim tha t the prosecutor made knowing use of perjured testimony was insufficient as a matter of law. Angelone v. Dabney, 263 Va. 323, 560 S.E.2d 253, 2002 Va. LEXIS 43 (2002). Conviction affirmed.  Defendants perjury conviction was affirmed where: (1) he was convicted under § 18.2-435, but the parties and the trial court proceeded at trial and on appe al as if defendant had been convicted for perjury under § 18.2-434; (2) defendants claim that there was not sufficient evidence to convict him of perjury because the evidence of falsity was uncorroborated was irrelevant as it was premised on the c ommon-law rule that perjury required proof of the falsity from at least two witnesses or one witness and corroborating evidence that did not apply to perjury under § 18.2-435; and (3) although there was no indication that defendant ever testified unde r oath on more than one occasion, the appellate court refused to apply the ends of justice exception to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 sua sponte. Sutphin v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 315, 734 S.E.2d 725, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 405 (2012). Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction for felony perjury because defendant gave conflicting testimony at two trials, and his testimony rega rding selling the marijuana was relevant to establishing his defense of necessity or self-defense.

Scearce v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 98, 561 S.E.2d 777, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 215 (2002). Defendants convictions for suborning perjury were reversed because the evidence failed to establish that defendant ever communicated to the two witnesses his plan for them to commit perjury; there was no causal connection between letters defendant wrote and the witnesses alleged perjury because the letters were intercepted at a jail, and there was no evidence establishing the recipients identi ty or relation to the witnesses.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3A M.J. Bribery, §§ 2, 4-6. CASE NOTES This section is not invalid because it does not in terms require that one accused thereu nder have knowledge that the bribe was offered to one in his official capacity. Livingston v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 830, 36 S.E.2d 561, 1946 Va. LEXIS 146 (1946). Bribery defined.  Bribery is the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting of anything of value with intent to influence the recipients action as a public official. Ford v. Co mmonwealth, 177 Va. 889, 15 S.E.2d 50, 1941 Va. LEXIS 270 (1941). The gist of the offense of bribery is the criminal intent to undermine the proper and or derly administration of justice. Ford v. Commonwealth, 177 Va. 889, 15 S.E.2d 50, 1941 Va. LEXIS 270 (1941). Offense is complet e with offer or promise of bribe.  Under this section, an attempt to corrupt, evidenced by an offer or promise of a gift, constitutes bribery on the part of the offeror or promisor as fully and com pletely as if a corrupt gift had been made and accepted. Ford v. Commonwealth, 177 Va. 889, 15 S.E.2d 50, 1941 Va. LEXIS 270 (1941). Section embrac es offer to pay for future protection.  In a prosecution for bribery, a constable testified that the accused had offered him six dollars a week if he would give her protection in the sale of whiskey. Th e accused contended that this section did not embrace an offer to pay for protection for an offense to be thereafter committed, or to pay an officer for his failure to perform his duty in the future. It was held that the comprehensive and inclusive langu age of this section negatived the contention of the accused. Ford v. Commonwealth, 177 Va. 889, 15 S.E.2d 50, 1941 Va. LEXIS 270 (1941). Indictment need not set out am ount of bribe.  An indictment for attempting to bribe a deputy sheriff to summon designated persons upon a jury to try a felony was held to be good, though the amount of the brib e was not set forth, and though the offense is not an offense at common law. Commonwealth v. Chapman, 3 Va. (1 Va. Cas.) 138 (1803). Nor state that accused had knowledge of official character of officer.  An indictment need not state that the accused had knowledge of the official character of the person to whom the bribe was offered, where the indictment necessaril y implied that the accused was being charged with knowledge that he was offering a bribe to a police officer. Livingston v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 830, 36 S.E.2d 561, 1946 Va. LEXIS 146 (1946). And it need not be in identical words of this section.  An indictment was held sufficient although it was not in the identical words of this section, as it gave the accused notice of the nature and character of the off ense charged so that he could make his defense. Livingston v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 830, 36 S.E.2d 561, 1946 Va. LEXIS 146 (1946). Evidence.  On an indictment for attempting to bribe an officer by offering to pay him a sum of money to release the accused and drop a proceeding against her for maintaining a disorderly house, it was not admissible to show that a young girl had been given whiskey to drink, and had had intercourse with a man at the house of the accused the previous night. Such evidence was entirely collateral to, and had no connection with, the alleged attempt to bribe the officer. Haynes v. Commonwealth, 104 Va. 854, 52 S.E. 358, 1905 Va. LEXIS 158 (1905). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Offer of $50,000 to drop out of political race not bribery.  Political candidates claims of libel arising out of a rivals alleged accusation of bribery were subject to demurrer because the statement made, that the c andidate offered a rival $50,000 to drop out of the race, did not constitute an allegation that the candidate gave money to influence her as a candidate in any official governmental decision.

Annotations CASE NOTES The offense punishable by this section is the omitting or delaying to perform any duty, etc., not the doing of any act. Old v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 915, 1867 Va. LEXIS 36 (1867). And not merely the duty to serve legal process.  This section punishes the omitting or delaying to perform any duty pertaining to the office of one who is authorized to serve legal process, and not merely the om itting or delaying to perform the duty to serve legal process. Old v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 915, 1867 Va. LEXIS 36 (1867). The presentment should follow the terms of this section, or must use terms which show co nclusively, or beyond any rational doubt to the contrary, that the accused is guilty of the offense described in this section. Unless this is done, the addition that so the accused did receive money for omitting and delaying to perform a duty pertain ing to his office of constable, etc., will not cure the defect. Old v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 915, 1867 Va. LEXIS 36 (1867). The natural and proper mode of charging a violation of this section is to aver that the accused was an officer authorized to serve legal process, as for example, a constable; that while he was such officer, it became his duty, as such, to perform a certain act, as for example, to warrant for a claim entrusted to him for that purpose and recoverable by warrant, or to serve a warrant which had been issued on such c laim, and placed in his hands for execution, etc., and that he unlawfully received a certain sum of money, or a certain other thing of value, for omitting or delaying to perform his said duty. While this would be the natural and proper mode of making the charge, and would conform to the very terms of this section, it might be sufficiently made in other terms which are substantially the same with those used in this section or which show conclusively or beyond a rational doubt to the contrary, that the ac cused is guilty of the offense described in this section at least such a defect would be cured by the verdict.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Conspiracy.  Investors allegation for statutory conspiracy under §§ 18.2-444 and 18.2-500 was defective because: (1) there was no allegation of malice; and (2) an al legation of conspiracy, whether criminal or civil, had to at least allege an unlawful act or an unlawful purpose, and the investor failed to do so.

The courts and judges may issue attachments for contempt, and punish them summarily, only in the following cases: 1. Misbe havior in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice; 2. Violence, or threats of violence, to a judge or officer of the court, or to a juror, witness, or party going to, attending, or returning from the court, for or in respect of any act or proceeding had, or to be had, in such court; 3. Vile, contemptuous, or insulting language addressed to or published of a judge for or in respect of any act or proceeding had, or to be had, in such court, or like language used in his presence and intended for his hearing for or in respect of such act or proceeding; 4. Misbehavior of an officer of the court in his official character; 5. Disobedience or resistance of an officer of the court, juror, witness, or other person to any lawful process, judgment, decree, or order of the court; and 6. Willful failure to appear before any court or judicial officer as required after having been charged with a felony offense or misdemeanor offense or released on a summons pursuant to § 19.2-73 or 19.2-74.

Commonwealth, 181 Va. 520, 25 S.E.2d 352, 1943 Va. LEXIS 201 (1943). As is subdivision (4).  In the context of lawyers, subdivision (4) is sufficiently definite to provide the notice requisite to constitutionality under the due process clause. Greene v.

Supp. 892, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8549 (E.D. Va. 1974). Classes of contempt.  Proceedings for contempt of court are of two classes,  those prosecuted to preserve the power and vindicate the dignity of the court and those to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties. The former are criminal and punitive in their nature; the latter are civil, remedial and coercive in their nature, and the parties chiefly interested in their conduct and prosecution are those individuals for the e nforcement of whose private rights and remedies the original suit was instituted. Local 333B, United Marine Div. of Int'l Longshoremen's Ass'n v. Commonwealth ex rel. Va. Ferry Corp., 193 Va. 773, 71 S.E.2d 159, 1952 Va. LEXIS 190, cert. denied, 344 U.S. 893, 73 S. Ct. 212, 97 L.

A contempt of court is in the nature of a criminal offense, and the proceeding for its p unishment is criminal in its character. B &amp; O R. R. v. City of Wheeling, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 40, 1855 Va. LEXIS 58 (1855). The purpose of a civil contempt proceeding is to procure the imposition of a punishment, which will afford remedial relief to an injured party, and in appropriate cases to preserve and enforce the rights and administer the remedies to which the court has found the persons for whose protection an injunction was granted to be entitled, and to require the violator of an injunction to restore the status quo as far as may be possible. French v. Town of Clintwood ex rel. Johnson, 203 Va. 562, 125 S.E.2d 798, 1962 Va. LEXIS 186 (1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 962, 83 S. Ct. 542, 9 L. Ed. 2d 510, 1 963 U.S. LEXIS 2275 (1963). Common-law contempt not bound within statutory sentencing guidelines.  Attorneys scheduling of various matters in different courts on the same day, and then his failure to call one of the courts to report that he would be tardy, was found to be sufficient to support the courts finding that he was guilty of common-law indirect criminal contempt; the court was not obligated to sentence him within the limits of §§ 18.2-456 and 18.2-457 because he was not charged with summ ary or direct contempt, and he had a plenary hearing prior to being found guilty. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 41 Va. App. 137, 583 S.E.2d 60, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 397 (2003). Contempt a s a criminal offense.  Trial court did not err by finding that defendant was charged with a criminal offense at the point of his initial arrest, and therefore his conviction for escape from custody conviction was affirmed, because his charge of criminal contempt was a criminal offense, as the issuance of the capias was directly related to his failure to comply with the conditions imposed upon him arising from his underlying assault and battery case, formal proceedings for the assault and battery had not been concluded when defendant escaped from the officers custody, and the officer knew of defendants outstanding warrant and attempted to arrest him. Lopez v. Commonwealth, 73 V a. App. 70, 854 S.E.2d 660, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (2021). Necessary adjuncts to administration of justice.  The dignity of the courts and the duty of the citizens to respect them are necessary adjuncts to the administration of justice. Salyer v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 66 2, 166 S.E.2d 110, 1969 Va. LEXIS 158 (1969). Scope of authority of Workers Compensation Commission.  Workers Compensation Commission has the same authority as a court to punish for noncompliance with its discovery orders and it has the inherent authority to s trike a partys defenses for failure to comply with a discovery order. Jeff Coal, Inc. v. Phillips, 16 Va. App. 271, 430 S.E.2d 712, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1261, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 95 (1993). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission abused its discretion in assessing 34 separate contempt fines for a professional employer organizations failure t o appear at a show cause hearing, one for each of its 34 client companies, as there was no statute or rule that vested the Commission with the authority to summarily divide one case into 34. Cura Group, Inc. v. Va. Workers' Comp. Comm'n, 45 Va. App. 559, 612 S.E.2d 735, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 181 (2005). II.Power of Courts. A.In General.

Research References. Friends Virginia Pleading and Practice (Matthew Bender). Chapter 15 Sanctions. § 15.10 Contempt. Friend. CASE NOTES This section o nly applies to first class of § 18.2-456.  The limitation of the duration of the imprisonment for contempt imposed by this section applies only to contempts mentioned in the first class of § 18.2-456, a nd not to those mentioned in the remaining four classes of that section. Yoder v. Commonwealth, 107 Va. 823, 57 S.E. 581, 1907 Va. LEXIS 85 (1907) (see Stroupe v. Rivero, No. 1936-02-4, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 630 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 9, 2003)). Defendants contempt sentences were not void for exceeding statutory limits because (1) defendant was found in contempt under subdivision (3) of § 18.2-456, and (2) the limitations in § 18.2-457 did not apply to the third class of contempt in § 18.2-456, as that limit applied to the first class of contempt under § 18.2-456. Harper v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 426 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 28, 2012 ). Jury trial not unreasonable safeguard for certain § 18.2-456 (1) contempts.  Since subdivision (1) of § 18.2-456 is not statutorily restricted in terms of highly specific conduct or specific persons as are the other subdivisions of that statute, it cannot be considered unreasonable for the legislature to have deemed it in the interest of justice to provide a slightly greater procedural safeguard, in the form of jury trial as provided by this section, for those contempts of this more ge neral subdivision which will be punished by a fine exceeding $50 or imprisonment of more than 10 days. Greene v. Tucker, 375 F. Supp. 892, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8549 (E.D. Va. 1974). What are serio us crimes for jury trial purposes.  Contempts punishable by more than six months imprisonment or a greater than $500 fine or both appear to constitute serious crimes for jury trial purpo ses. Greene v. Tucker, 375 F. Supp. 892, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8549 (E.D. Va. 1974). Penalty im posed is evidence of seriousness of offense.  Since Virginia does not specify sentencing limits for cases of contempt, the court must look to the penalty actually imposed as the best evidence of the seriousne ss of the offense. Greene v. Tucker, 375 F. Supp. 892, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8549 (E.D. Va. 1974). Fine limited to $50 (now $250).  Fine of $400 for contempt was excessive: where punishment is by fine and determined without a jury, amount of fine is limited to $50 (now $250). Brown v. Commonwe alth, 26 Va. App. 758, 497 S.E.2d 147, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (1998). Where the appellant was held in contempt for failure to appear at a pretrial conference and there was nothing in the record to indicate that she failed to comply with a discovery order, the courts contempt power did not flow from Rule 4:12, and instead, the fine was limited to $50 (now $250) under this section. Roberts v. Haiar, No. 2096-97-1 (Ct. of Appeals February 24, 1998). Excessive sentence.  Where defendants use of profanity toward the prosecutor at defendants sentencing hearing supported a contempt finding under § 18.2-456 (1), defendant s sentence, imposed without a jury, of 12 months in jail and a $1,000 fine was excessive under the applicable sentencing statute, § 18.2-457, to the extent that it exceeded a jail term of 10 days and a $250 fine; the sentence was vacated and a sen tence of 10 days in jail and a $250 fine was imposed. Middlebrooks v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 433 (Va. Ct. App. July 30, 2002). Common-law contempt not bound within statutory sentencing guidelines.  Attorneys scheduling of various matters in different courts on the same day, and then his failure to call one of the courts to report that he would be tardy, was found to be sufficient to support the courts finding that he was guilty of common-law indirect criminal contempt; the court was not obligated to sentence him within the limits of §§ 18.2-456 and 18.2-457 because he was not charged with summ ary or direct contempt, and he had a plenary hearing prior to being found guilty. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 41 Va. App. 137, 583 S.E.2d 60, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 397 (2003). No right to jury.  Trial court did not err in the manner it conducted defendants proceedings involving civil and criminal contempt charges for his conduct in making courthouse s ecurity decisions in his role as sheriff; the record indicated that defendant was afforded all rights and privileges due him in a criminal proceeding and he was not permitted to have a jury because the Commonwealth proceeded under § 18.2-457, which al lowed a punishment of no more than 10 days in jail. Epps v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 687, 626 S.E.2d 912, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 102 (2006), aff'd, 273 Va. 410, 641 S.E.2d 77, 2007 Va. LEXIS 35 (2007). Impermissible sanction.  In the absence of authority granted by a statute, a trial courts inherent power to supervise the conduct of attorneys practicing before it and to discipline a n attorney who engages in misconduct does not include the power to impose as a sanction an award of attorneys fees and costs to the opposing parties. If an attorneys conduct is disruptive of court processes or disrespectful of the court itself, t here is ample power to punish the misconduct as contempt. Nusbaum v.

LEXIS 23 (2008). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Verbal direction to sheriffs deputies to take defendant into custody for a specified number of hours, is equivalent to a written order and therefore is binding upon the sheriffs office, and sheriffs deputies carrying out s uch orders enjoy the same qualified sovereign immunity they have when others are in their custody. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Dennis S. Proffitt, Sheriff, County of Chesterfield, 10-069, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 52 (8/30/10). Prefiling review.  A district court may, pursuant to § 8.01-271.1, impose a pre-filing review requirement if such a sanction is appropriate. Further, a district court has the inh erent authority to limit or prevent an attorney or a litigant from practicing before it in the event the court determines, after a hearing, that the attorney or litigant has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law or otherwise has engaged in unprofes sional or unethical conduct.

Chapter 15 Sanctions. § 15.10 Contempt. Friend. CASE NOTES Construction with other laws.  Where the provisions of §§ 16.1-69.24 and 18.2-459 address the specific subject of appeals from summary contempt adjudications in the district courts, and t he provisions of §§ 16.1-132 and 16.1-136 address the general subject of appeals from the district courts, to the extent that the more specific provisions of §§ 16.1-69.24 and § 18.2-459 are in conflict with the general provisions of § § 16.1-132 and 16.1-136, the more specific statutes prevail. Gilman v. Commonwealth, 275 Va. 222, 657 S.E.2d 474, 2008 Va. LEXIS 23 (2008). Under the plain meaning of § 18.2-459, an appellant is entitled to present evidence in the circuit court, and the court commits an error of law by interpreting the phrase legal testimony to mean simply legal argument. Unger v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 394 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 22, 2015). By its plain reading, this section directs the circuit court to reach an independent determination regarding the contemnors guilt, while using the district co urts recitation of what occurred in that courts presence, along with any legal testimony presented to the circuit court by either party. Unger v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 394 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 22, 2015). No rights under confrontation clause.  Virginia legislature does not intend to give birth to a constitutional right to cross-examine a juvenile and domestic relations district court (JDR court) judge a t an appeal of a petty direct summary contempt proceeding, a right that a defendant does not otherwise have in the JDR court or the circuit court, as: (1) a JDR court proceeding is not a criminal prosecution within the scope of the Sixth Amendment; (2) t here is no constitutional right to trial at the JDR court and no constitutional right of appeal; (3) there is a statutory prohibition against calling a judge as a witness; and (4) the Virginia general assembly provides a statutory right of appeal with th e caveat that a certificate from the JDR court can be used in such an appeal. Gilman v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 16, 628 S.E.2d 54, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 130, op. withdrawn, vacated, 49 Va. App. 1, 635 S.E.2d 309, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 456 (2006). Confrontation clause rights no t violated.  Defendants rights under the Confrontation Clause were not violated by the use of a certificate from a juvenile and domestic relations district court (JDR cour t) judge in her appeal from a conviction for petty direct summary contempt as the Virginia legislature did not intend to give birth to a constitutional right to cross-examine a JDR court judge at an appeal of a petty direct summary contempt proceeding as : (1) a JDR court proceeding was not a criminal prosecution within the scope of the Sixth Amendment; (2) there was no constitutional right to trial at the JDR court and no constitutional right of appeal; (3) there was a statutory prohibition against call ing a judge as a witness; and (4) the Virginia general assembly provided a statutory right of appeal with the caveat that a certificate from the JDR court could be used in such an appeal. Gilman v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 16, 628 S.E.2d 54, 2006 Va. Ap p. LEXIS 130, op. withdrawn, vacated, 49 Va. App. 1, 635 S.E.2d 309, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 456 (2006). Because the provisions of § 16.1-69.24 and § 18.2-459 had to prevail over the more general provisions of §§ 16.1-132 and 16.1-136, a contemnor appeali ng an adjudication of summary contempt does not receive a trial de novo in the circuit court with attendant Sixth Amendment protections and, thus, does not have a Sixth Amendment right of confrontation in that summary contempt adjudication in the circuit court. Gilman v. Commonwealth, 275 Va. 222, 657 S.E.2d 474, 2008 Va. LEXIS 23 (2008). Reviewing court did not violate defendants due process right to confrontation by admitting into evidence the juvenile and domestic relations courts certif icate of the summary contempt conviction and particular circumstances of the offense under § 18.2-459 as no litigant in a summary contempt case had a right to cross-examine the judge under the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, and the Due Proces s Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, did not afford a right of confrontation where the Sixth Amendment did not. Parham v. Commonwealth, 60 Va. App. 450, 729 S.E.2d 734, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 248 (2012). Due process not violated.  Denial of appellants motion to dismiss the district court contempt adjudication was not error where she did not claim a systemic due process violation, and th us, an appeal in the circuit court in compliance with § 18.2-459 requirements was the only remedy available to appellant on the facts of the case. Unger v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 394 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 22, 2015). Error to allow judges testimony.  Trial court erred in allowing the sitting circuit judge to testify in defendants civil and criminal contempt case where defendant defied the trial courts order to have a deputy at the courthouse entrance during weekly business hours, and he took down signs ordered to be posted by the trial court about when the courthouse would be closed absent a deputy at the front entrance despite at least one request by the trial court that a sign and corresponding order be returned; the court itself, and not the trial judge, was the victim of defendants contemptuous conduct and other statutory authority, such as § 18.2-459, did not permit a judicial officer who simply witnesses contemptuous behavior to testify. Epps v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 687, 626 S.E.2d 912, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 102 (2006), aff'd, 273 Va. 410, 641 S.E.2d 77, 2007 Va. LEXIS 35 (2007). Defendant could not complain on appeal of evidence that he introduced at trial.  Because the results of an Alcosensor test for blood alcohol content were properly admitted and considered by the circuit court as the fact finder, and defendant d id not object to the admission of the general district court certificate of the conviction, filed pursuant to § 18.2-459, which he himself introduced into evidence, his contempt conviction was upheld on appeal. Rozario v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. App. 142 , 647 S.E.2d 502, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 272 (2007). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Confrontation clause rights no t violated.  Defendants constitutional right of confrontation was not violated when a certificate of conviction and particular circumstances of an offense prepared by a ju venile and domestic relations district court judge was admitted into evidence against her where the court was exercising its contempt jurisdiction; the basic confrontation rights only applied when a court exercised its criminal jurisdiction. Commonwealth v. Tanner, 73 Va. Cir. 434, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 214 (Roanoke County July 17, 2007). Construction with other laws.  Sections 16.1-69.24 and 18.2-459 explicitly allow appeals to the circuit courts from summary contempt convictions in the district courts, but not for dismissals; by necessary implication, subsection H of § 16.1-296 allows appeals from findings of civil or criminal contempt in the juvenile and domestic relations district courts for failure to pay support, as the statute establishes bond requirements for appeals .

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  This section was not unconstitutional in granting the prosecutor discretion to charge a defendants conduct as either a misdemeanor under subsection B or as a felony under subsection C, where there was no principled basis for differentiating between prosecutorial discretion afforded the government when a defendant had violated more than one criminal statute and prosecutorial discretion when the charging decisi on involved two subsections of the same statute. Bishop v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 251, 639 S.E.2d 683, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 20 (2007), rev'd, vacated, dismissed in part, 275 Va. 9, 654 S.E.2d 906, 2008 Va. LEXIS 19 (2008). Because defendant threatened to kill a police officer, and because the speech proscribed by subsection C of § 18.2-460 encompassed only threats of bodily h arm, the statute was not unconstitutional either facially or as applied to defendant; fighting words were not necessary for a conviction under the statute. Wise v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 344, 641 S.E.2d 134, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 68 (2007). Subsection C of § 18.2-460 does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech and is not facially violative of the First Amendment; f ighting words are not necessary for a conviction under § 18.2-460. Wise v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 344, 641 S.E.2d 134, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 68 (2007). Legislative intent.  The absence of language in this section relating to use of a weapon indicates the legislative intent to include in the misdemeanor offense of obstructing justice less violent types of conduct, and to make conduct accompanied by the use of a weapon subject to prosecution for greater offenses, such as attempted murder. Martin v. Commonwealth, 242 Va. 1, 406 S.E.2d 15, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2757, 1991 Va. LEXIS 111, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 945, 112 S. Ct. 388, 116 L. Ed. 2d 339, 1991 U.S. LEXIS 6485 (1991). The statute was enacted for the purpose of deterring those who intimidate any witness lawfully engaged in his duties as such. Fleming v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 349, 412 S.E.2d 180, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1497, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 309 (1991). Concluding that a particular action is vile, abhorrent, and criminal does not compel the conclusion that the activity violates a specific statute. Mendez v. Commo nwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 59 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 12, 2019). Threatening violence against anyone is wrong, and through the statutes it has enacted, the General Assembly has determined that threatening certain public officia ls as they attempt to perform their official duties is more egregious than the average threat because the threat is made not only against the individual but the office he or she holds as a representative of the people as sovereign. Mendez v. Commonwealth , 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 59 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 12, 2019). Fair reading of the relating to requirement is that the threat and attempted obstruction have a direct relationship to the enumerated felony; the over riding purpose of subsection C is to prevent the use of threats to attempt to intimidate or impede a covered individual from carrying out his or her duty related to an enumerated felony. Mendez v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 59 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 1 2, 2019). Attempted arson fell within the proscribed offenses in the felony obstruction statute because the language of the obstruction statute, when considered in conjunct ion with the language of the statute that it incorporated by reference, subsection C of § 17.1-805, reflected an intention by the legislature to proscribe attempt crimes. Tanner v. Commonwealth, 72 Va. App. 86, 841 S.E.2d 377, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 131 (2020). Evidence of fleeing insufficient.  Evidence was insufficient to support defendants conviction for resisting arrest because, although defendants actions certainly demonstrated resistance and efforts to avoid physical custody, there was no evidence of defendant fleeing from an officer, a necessary element of the offense of resisting arrest, as defendant remained continuously in close proximity to the arresting officer at all times. Joseph v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 332, 768 S.E.2d 256, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 36 (2015). Evidence was sufficient to support the trial courts conclusions that defendant obstructed justice because there was testimony that defendant checked off  or pushed off of an officer as the officer att...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-461"><akn:num>§ 18.2-461</akn:num><akn:heading>Falsely summoning or giving false reports to law-enforcement officials</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text It shall be unlawful for any person (i) to knowingly give a false report as to the commission of any crime to any law-enforcement official with intent to mislead; (ii) to knowingly, with the intent to mislead a law-enforcement agency, cause another to give a false report to any law-enforcement official by publicly simulating a violation of Chapter 4 (§ 18.2-30 et seq.) or Chapter 5 (§ 18.2-77 et seq.); or (iii) w ithout just cause and with intent to interfere with the operations of any law-enforcement official, to call or summon any law-enforcement official by telephone or other means, including engagement or activation of an automatic emergency alarm. Violation of the provisions of this section shall be punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor. However, if a person intentionally gives a false report as to the commission of any crime to any law-enforcement official, causes another to give a false report to any law-en forcement official, or calls or summons any law-enforcement official against another person because of his race, religious conviction, gender, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, color, or national origin, the person is guilty of a Class 6 f elony.

CASE NOTES Lack of probable cause to arrest.  Because the police lacked probable cause to arrest defendant for either falsely summoning police or for disorderly conduct, the trial court erred in denying his m otion to suppress the drugs obtained from his arrest and defendants conviction for the possession of cocaine was improper. Thor v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 88 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 9, 2010). Evidence sufficient.  Evidence was sufficient to show that defendant intended to mislead police by falsely reporting an incident to them, and to sustain his conviction under § 18.2- 461(i), where defendant rode with a driver and passenger in a gray Camaro for an extended period of time on the night in question, where, having tired of defendants repeated requests for her to drive him to various locations, the driver told defendan t she wanted to take him home, where defendant was verbally abusive to the driver and tried to prevent her from driving to his residence, where, once they reached defendants residence, defendant told the driver he would get her back, where de fendant immediately called the police and reported two women had shot at his residence from a gray Camaro and that the women possessed cocaine, and where, stopped by the police within minutes of defendants call, the driver and her passenger possessed neither firearms nor drugs. Kimberlin v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 148 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 12, 2005). Evidence was sufficient to show that defendant provided false information to a law-enforcement officer because defendant falsely told a Department of Motor Vehicl es agent information about a license applicant, including that she was his wife and that she worked at two particular stores. Melendez v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 171 (Va. Ct. App. May 4, 2010). Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of knowingly giving a false report of a crime to a law-enforcement official with the intent to mislead because defend ants false description of the officers penetration of her vagina and anus alleged the commission of a crime as the existence of defenses against defendants accusations did not mean that she did not allege the commission of a crime, and, even assuming for the sake of argument that defendants false accusation did not describe a crime under Virginia law, her accusation alleged a violation of federal law; and because defendants description of that crime to a special agent of the Virginia State Police constituted a report. Dunne v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. App. 24, 782 S.E.2d 170, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (2016). Evidence, including text messages showing increasing conflict between defendant and the alleged assailant leading up to the rape report and defendants inconsi stent statements, was sufficient to support defendants conviction for making a false report to law enforcement. Bryant v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 159 (Va. Ct. App. May 10, 2016). Trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to convict defendant of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, making a false report of child abus e or neglect, and giving a false report to a law-enforcement official because it was entitled to reject defendants theory that she did not cause her daughter to fabricate child abuse; it was reasonable to infer that defendant used an audio file to he lp her daughter provide a full account of the alleged child abuse to authorities. Gibson v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (Va. Ct. App. July 23, 2019). Evidence clearly established that defendant did unlawfully make and cause to be made a false report of child abuse because her daughter acted as an innocent agent for defendant, who was therefore guilty as a principal in the first degree; because defendant engaged in actions that caused her daughter to commit a crime as an innocent agent of defendant, she was guilty of giving a false report to law-enforcement as a principal in the first degree. Gibson v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (Va. Ct. App. July 23, 2019). Passenger not an informant.  Trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to suppress cocaine the police discovered in defendants vehicle incident to an arrest on a separate c harge because the police did not rely on the passenger of the vehicle as an informant since the passenger was not an informant, and his reliability and basis of knowledge were not factors in determining whether the police had probable cause to arrest def endant; unlike an anonymous tipster, the passenger was known to the police and personally spoke with them, and by telling the police that defendant was the driver and possessed the cocaine, the passenger was subjecting himself to possible arrest if the i nformation proved false under § 18.2-461, and placed his credibility at risk and could not lie with impunity. Jones v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 98 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 22, 2011). Venue.  Because defendant made a false report regarding the commission of a crime to law enforcement officials in Loudoun County, Loudoun County was a proper venue in whi ch to prosecute the offense. McGuire v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 736, 813 S.E.2d 552, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 137 (2018). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No private right of action.  Police officer, who claimed that other police officers conspired to conceal events surrounding the death of a suspect and compelled him to testify falsely about t hose events, did not have a private right of action against a city or its employees to recover damages he sustained when he was terminated from the citys police department.

B. Any person, other than the victim of the crime or the husband, wife, parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother, or sister, by consanguinity or affinity of the offender, who with actual knowledge of the commission by another of any felony offense under Chapter 4 (§ 18.2-30 et seq.) of this title, willfully conceals, alters, dismembers, or destroys any item of physical evidence with the intent to delay, impede, obstruct, prevent, or hinder the investigation, apprehension, prosecution, conviction, or punishm ent of any person regarding such offense is guilty of a Class 6 felony.

For related discussion, see 4A M.J. Compounding Offenses, §§ 2, 3, 4. CASE NOTES Application of section.  Defendants, tobacco warehousemen, procured plaintiffs arrest upon a warrant for a misdemeanor under act which provides that it shall be a misdemeanor to procu re a loan from a tobacco warehouseman upon a written promise or pledge to sell tobacco through such warehouseman, and fail to comply with such pledge, or repay the amount borrowed. Defendants upon obtaining a settlement of their claim against plaintiff, had him released and the warrant dismissed. It was held that the transaction did not fall within the condemnation of this section, but rather within the spirit, if not within the terms, of § 19.2-151. Glidewell v. Murray-Lacy &amp; Co., 124 Va. 563, 98 S. E. 665, 1919 Va. LEXIS 148 (1919). Plaintiffs, who sought to recover money claimed to have been paid to prevent prosecuting of kinsman for embezzlement, contended that because this section imposes a penalty for receiving a consideration to compound a felony, but not upon the person paying the consideration, the parties were not in pari delicto and therefore plaintiffs should be permitted to recover. It was held that such contracts are illegal rega rdless of statute, as they tend to suppress evidence and impede the due course of public justice. Ellis v. Peoples Nat'l Bank, 166 Va. 389, 186 S.E. 9, 1936 Va. LEXIS 201 (1936).

Text A. Any person subject to Chapter 9 (§ 9.1-900 et seq.) of Title 9.1, other than a person convicted of a Tier III offense or murder as defined in § 9.1-902, who knowingly fails to register, reregister, or verify his registration information, or who knowingly prov ides materially false information to the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. A second or subsequent conviction for an offense under this subsection is a Class 6 felony. B. Any person convicted of a Tier III offense or murder, as defined in § 9.1-902, who knowingly fails to register, reregister, or verify his registration information, or who knowingly provides materially false information to the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Mino rs Registry is guilty of a Class 6 felony. A second or subsequent conviction for an offense under this subsection is a Class 5 felony. C. A prosecuti on pursuant to this section shall be brought in the city or county where the offender can be found or where the offender last registered, reregistered, or verified his registration information or, if the offender failed to comply with the duty to registe r, where the offender was last convicted of an offense for which registration or reregistration is required. D. At any prel iminary hearing pursuant to this section, an affidavit from the State Police issued as required in § 9.1-907 shall be admitted into evidence as prima facie evidence of the failure to comply with the duty to register, reregister, or verify his registra tion information. A copy of such affidavit shall be provided to the registrant or his counsel seven days prior to hearing or trial by the attorney for the Commonwealth. E. The accused in any preliminary hearing in which an affidavit from the State Police issued as required in § 9.1-907 is offered into evidence pursuant to this section shall have the right to summon and call a custodian of records issuing the affidavit and examine him in the same manner as if he had been called as an adverse witness. Such witness shall appear at the cost of the Commonwealth. F. At any tria l or hearing other than a preliminary hearing conducted pursuant to this section, an affidavit from the State Police issued as required in § 9.1-907 shall constitute prima facie evidence of the failure to comply with the duty to register, reregister, or verify his registration information, provided the requirements of subsection G have been satisfied and the accused has not objected to the admission of the affidavit pursuant to subsection H. G. If the atto rney for the Commonwealth intends to offer the affidavit into evidence in lieu of testimony at a trial or hearing, other than a preliminary hearing, he shall: 1. Provi de by mail, delivery, or otherwise, a copy of the affidavit to counsel of record for the accused, or to the accused if he is proceeding pro se, at no charge, no later than 28 days prior to the hearing or trial; 2.

Such objection shall be filed with the court hearing the matter, with a copy t o the attorney for the Commonwealth, no more than 14 days after the affidavit and notice were filed with the clerk by the attorney for the Commonwealth, or the objection shall be deemed waived. If timely objection is made, the affidavit shall not be admi ssible into evidence unless (i) the objection is waived by the accused or his counsel in writing or before the court, or (ii) the parties stipulate before the court to the admissibility of the affidavit. I. Where a cus todian of the records is not available for hearing or trial and the attorney for the Commonwealth has used due diligence to secure the presence of the person, the court shall order a continuance. Any continuances ordered pursuant to this subsection shall total not more than 90 days if the accused has been held continuously in custody and not more than 180 days if the accused has not been held continuously in custody. J. Any objecti on by counsel for the accused, or the accused if he is proceeding pro se, to timeliness of the receipt of notice required by subsection G shall be made before hearing or trial upon his receipt of actual notice unless the accused did not receive actual no tice prior to hearing or trial. A showing by the Commonwealth that the notice was mailed, delivered, or otherwise provided in compliance with the time requirements of this section shall constitute prima facie evidence that the notice was timely received by the accused. If the court finds upon the accuseds objection made pursuant to this subsection, that he did not receive timely notice pursuant to subsection G, the accuseds objection shall not be deemed waived and if the objection is made prior to hearing or trial, a continuance shall be ordered if requested by either party. Any continuance ordered pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the time limitations set forth in subsection I. K. For the pur poses of this section any conviction for a substantially similar offense under the laws of (i) any foreign country or any political subdivision thereof, or (ii) any state or territory of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, the Distric t of Columbia, or the United States shall be considered a prior conviction.

CASE NOTES Not precluded by double je opardy principles.  Circuit court was not precluded by double jeopardy principles from trying defendant for delivering marijuana to a prisoner, in violation of § 18.2-474.1, after she pled guilty in a district court to a charge alleging that she possessed the same marijuana, in violation of § 18.2-250.1, because possession of marijuana was not a lesser-included offense of delivering marijuana to a prisoner. Logan v. Commonweal th, 43 Va. App. 504, 600 S.E.2d 133, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 374 (2004). Compared to § 18.2-474.1.  In order to manufacture, sell, give, distribute, or possess a controlled drug, which is an element of the crime of distribution under § 18.2-248, a defendant m ust possess that controlled substance. The same analysis does not apply to the crime of delivering a controlled substance to a prisoner, in violation of § 18.2-474.1.Logan v. Commonwealth, 43 Va. App. 504, 600 S.E.2d 133, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 374 (2004 ). Evidence sufficient to a ffirm conviction, etc. Evidence sufficient to affirm conviction for attempting to deliver marijuana to a prison er where the testimony of the deputies showed that no one other than defendant entered the restroom before one of the deputies found the marijuana. Gilliam v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 515 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 14, 2003). Evidence sufficiently supported defendants conviction for delivery of marijuana to her husband, a prisoner at a correctional facility, as the testimony of cor rectional officers and expert witnesses, as well as videotape evidence and still photographs, was sufficient to show that defendant transferred marijuana to her husband while visiting him at the correctional facility where he was incarcerated. Rodgers v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 257 (Va. Ct. App. July 5, 2005). Evidence was sufficient to support defendants convictions for possession with the intent to distribute Methadone and Diazepamin and attempt to deliver to a pr isoner a controlled substance in violation of §§ 18.2-248 and 18.2-474.1 because defendant knew of the procedures to turn in prescription medication at a jail annex, and not only did he fail to follow those procedures, but he also concealed the pil ls in his underwear and told a sergeant that he brought the pills into the jail to give to other inmates so his stay would go a lot easier; defendant took all the necessary steps to accomplish his objective of delivering drugs to others in the ja il annex because in preparation for reporting to jail, he concealed drugs, for which he had no prescription, he entered the jail with those drugs, and he failed to report the drugs to jail personnel, and but for a strip search, he would have completed hi s crimes. Hounshell v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 443 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2010). Evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant attempted to deliver marijuana to prisoner, where the proof concerning defendants conduct was equivocal and did not establish more than mere preparation.

CASE NOTES Mistakenly indicating that prosecution is under this section.  Where, prior to the defendants arraignment and plea, in response to an inquiry by defense counsel, the Commonwealths attorney mistakenly indicated that he was proceeding against the defendant under this section, the defendants claim that this was an election by the Commonwealth, which limited his punishment to the maximum provided by this section, was without merit since the defendant, prior to his pl ea, was advised by both his counsel and the trial court that the prosecution was being conducted under former § 53-291, and was also advised that he, as an inmate of a penal institution, was subject to a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment if he had inflicted bodily injury on the guard from whose custody he escaped, a fact that was later established by uncontroverted evidence.

CASE NOTES Elements.  Because assault of an officer is not a lesser included offense of escape from a police officer by use of force or violence under the statute and because defendant s act of obstructing justice was a separate and distinct act from his escape, which the Commonwealths evidence supported, defendants escape conviction was well founded. Henry v. Commonwealth, 21 Va. App. 141, 462 S.E.2d 578, 1995 Va. App. LEX IS 729 (1995). Evidence that defendant ran away from an officer who was escorting him to a police wagon and was subsequently caught and subdued by three officers did not prove b eyond a reasonable doubt that defendant used force to attempt to escape. Bell v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 151 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 12, 2002). Evidence of custody.  Because the Commonwealth had to prove that the appellant was in custody and that the custody was on a charge of criminal offense, the existence of warrant for appellants arrest was relevant to prove that appellant was being arrested on criminal charges. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 21 Va. App. 102, 462 S.E.2d 125, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 703 (1995). A person is in custody for the purposes of escape under this statute when by physical force, words, or actions, that person becomes subject to the officers co ntrol; thus, if a person of ordinary intelligence and understanding would not feel free to leave under the circumstances, then he or she is in custody for purposes of this section. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 21 Va. App. 102, 462 S.E.2d 125, 1995 Va . App. LEXIS 703 (1995). Because a police officer grabbed defendants wrist in an attempt to handcuff him and told him that he was under arrest, before defendant struggled free and esc aped moments later, defendant was under arrest and therefore in custody for purposes of the escape statute. Hall v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. App. 451, 686 S.E.2d 554, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 567 (2009), aff'd, 280 Va. 566, 701 S.E.2d 68, 2010 Va. LEXIS 263 (2010 ). Evidence showed that the officer went to defendants residence and advised defendant that he had a warrant for his arrest, that after directing defendant to st ep onto the front porch, the officer lawfully advised defendant that he was under arrest and grabbed defendants left wrist to handcuff him, and that the officer spoke words of arrest and actually touched defendant for the stated purpose of arrest; th erefore, at that moment, notwithstanding defendants subsequent flight, the arrest was effected and defendant was in custody since an individual under arrest was always in custody. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant was i n custody pursuant to § 18.2-478 prior to his forcibly wrestling free of the officers grasp, and that defendant escaped from custody by force or violence in violation of § 18.2-478. Hall v. Commonwealth, 280 Va. 566, 701 S.E.2d 68, 2010 Va. LEX IS 263 (2010). Defendant not charged wi th a criminal offense.  Charge of escape by force from the custody of a police officer should have been dismissed where there was no evidence that defendant was charged with a criminal o ffense; the evidence showed that police stopped defendant because they had report that the car he was driving was stolen, not because he was charged with a criminal offense. Coles v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 549, 605 S.E.2d 784, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 612 (2004). No evidence of written charge.  Evidence was insufficient to sustain defendants conviction of felonious escape from custody, in violation of § 18.2-478, where the Commonwealth did not int roduce any evidence that there was a written charge against him at the time he was allegedly taken into custody by an officer following an attempted traffic stop and foot chase. Hubbard v. Commonwealth, 276 Va. 292, 661 S.E.2d 464, 2008 Va. LEXIS 61 (200 8). To sustain a conviction under § 18.2-478, the evidence must show a defendant was taken into custody pursuant to a written charge; probable cause to arrest will not suffice to satisfy the on a charge of criminal offense element stated in § 18.2-478. Hubbard v. Commonwealth, 276 Va. 292, 661 S.E.2d 464, 2008 Va. LEXIS 61 (2008). Evidence sufficient.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of attempted felony escape because there was no damage to the cell before his detainment; he was the only person to u se the bathroom before officers discovered the damage; the officers discovered a large hole in the ceiling within minutes of transferring defendant from the cell; and the evidence revealed no other explanation for why he created a one to two foot hole in the holding cells bathroom ceiling. Childress v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 288 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 15, 2013). Trial court did not err by finding that defendant was charged with a criminal offense at the point of his initial arrest, and therefore his conviction for escape from custody conviction was affirmed, because his charge of criminal contempt was a criminal offense, as the issuance of the capias was directly related to his failure to comply with the conditions imposed upon him arising from his underlying assault and battery case, formal proceedings for the assault and battery had not been concluded when defendant escaped from the officers custody, and the officer knew of defendants outstanding warrant and attempted to arrest him. Lopez v. Commonwealth, 73 V a. App. 70, 854 S.E.2d 660, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (2021). Sufficiency of the e vidence claim not preserved.  Defendant failed to preserve his sufficiency of the evidence claim as to his escape conviction under § 18.2-478 where: (1) he failed to renew his motion to str ike made at the close of the Commonwealths case, and proceeded to put on his own evidence, thereby waiving his right to stand on the motion made at the conclusion of the Commonwealths case; (2) renewing the arguments made in support of his motion to strike in his closing argument did not preserve a sufficiency argument for purposes of an appeal; and (3) he made a different argument in support of his motion to set aside the verdict in the trial court than he made on appeal, which under Va. Sup. C t. R. 5A:18, precluded the appellate court from considering the argument on appeal. Anthony v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 654 (Va. Ct.

Nothing in this section indicates it establishes the exclusive offense for persons who escape before conviction or assignment to the penitentiary (now state correctional facility) system, and nothing in former § 53-291 indicates it is applicable only to those who escape after conviction and assignment to the penitentiary system. Mason v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 321, 228 S.E.2d 683, 1976 Va. LEXIS 280 (1976) (decided under § 18.1-290, predecessor to this section). Conviction under this section or former § 53-291 bars prosecution under the other. Mas on v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 321, 228 S.E.2d 683, 1976 Va. LEXIS 280 (1976) (decided under § 18.1-290, predecessor to this section). It is a matter of prosecutorial election whether the Commonwealth proceeds under this section or former § 53-291 against an accused. Mason v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 321, 228 S.E.2d 683, 1976 Va. LEXIS 280 (1976) (decided under § 18.1-290, predecessor to this section). For case comparing punishment provisions of this section and former § 53-208, see Dur kin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). Attempted crimes are specific intent crimes, and therefore, where the Commonwealth charg es a defendant with attempted escape, it is required to prove that: (1) the defendant intended to escape from custody; and (2) he engaged in some act in furtherance of escaping. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 442, 546 S.E.2d 209, 2001 Va. App. LEXI S 262 (2001). Violent felony for f ederal sentencing purposes.  Despite its title, a conviction for escape under subsection B of § 18.2-479, constituted a violent felony for purposes of sentencing under the Armed Career Cri minal Act, 18 U.S.C.S § 924(e), because the title was irrelevant to this determination, particularly as every escape, no matter how conducted, involved conduct that presented a serious potential risk of physical injury, and § 18.2-479, by its plain text, punished those who unlawfully and feloniously escaped from confinement. United States v. Mathias, 482 F.3d 743, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 8524 (4th Cir. 2007), vacated, 555 U.S. 1132, 129 S. Ct. 989, 173 L. Ed. 2d 286, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 757 (2009). No felony escape if occurred during custody for misdemeanor.  Defendants conviction for felony escape under subsection B of § 18.2-479 was reversed because at the time of his escape he had only been arrested for a mis demeanor and the arresting officer did not yet know that he had prior petit larceny convictions. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 513 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 14, 2003). Application of force to complete a rrest.  Where a police officer clearly stated that defendant could not drive her truck based on a felony capias for her arrest, and applied physical force to complete the arrest, the evidence supported defendants escape conviction. Harris v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 25 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 28, 2003). Lesser-inc luded offense of escape by force or violence.  Defendants conviction of nonviolent escape from custody, as a lesser-included offense of escape by force or violence, was upheld, as the jury was authorized t o conclude from the evidence presented that defendant disappeared while in custody, was left alone in an interview room, and was never found by law-enforcement officials; further, because he was convicted of a lesser-included offense, the indictment did not require the Commonwealth to prove he used force when he escaped. McBrayer v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 467 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 5, 2004). The evidence was sufficient for a jury to have found that defendant knew he was in custody and not free to leave where, although the defendant arrived the police station voluntarily, he came there for the purpose of having two felony arrest warrants served on him, a deputy testified that by the time the defendant had attempted to leave, he had already served the warrants on the defendant, when the defendant began to leave, the deputy ordered the defendant to stop, the defendant ignored the deputys request to stop and the defendant had to be physically restrained. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 442, 546 S.E.2d 209, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 262 (2001). Appellant was not in officers cu stody.  Officer did not effectuate his legal authority to arrest appellant; he neither touched appellant nor obtained appellants submission to his authority. Each tim e officer spoke to appellant, appellant responded with profanity. When officer told appellant not to run, appellant responded that he was going to run, and he did. In short, the evidence showed that appellant did not submit, in any respect, to a show of authority. Appellant was not in officers custody at the time he ran, and accordingly, the court reversed his escape conviction. Cavell v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 82, 493 S.E.2d 382, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 717 (1997). When officer determined to place defendant in custody, he did not have physical control over defendant, and defendant fled before the officer could obtain that de gree of control; thus, defendant was not in custody and his flight was not an escape under subsection B of § 18.2-479. White v. Commonwealth, 267 Va. 96, 591 S.E.2d 662, 2004 Va. LEXIS 9 (2004). Whether a person is in custody for purposes of the statute depends upon whether the officer has applied direct physical restraint or, in the absence of restraint, whether the person has submitted to a show of authority. Towns v. Commonwealth, No. 1720-97-3 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 10, 1998). An individual is in custody, as contemplated by § 18.2-479, when a law enforcement officer has lawfully curtailed the individuals freedom of moveme nt to a degree associated with a formal arrest, even when a formal custodial arrest has not been effected. Applying an objective standard, the inquiry is whether the officer, with proper authority to do so, had by his words or use of physical force, curt ailed the individuals freedom of movement beyond that required for a temporary investigative detention. White v. Commonwealth, 267 Va. 96, 591 S.E.2d 662, 2004 Va. LEXIS 9 (2004). Custody not shown.  Whether a person is in custody for the purposes of this section depends upon whether the officer has applied direct physical restraint, or in the absence of restraint, whether the person has submitted to a show of authority. Thus, where defendant was present in the courthouse on another matter; officer did not physically touch or restrain defendant; and while defendant admitted that he walked to officer w hen his name was called, he never submitted to a show of authority, rather it was undisputed the moment officer began to read from warrant, defendant ran away, defendant was not in custody at the time he fled and therefore his conviction of escape was re versed. Towns v. Commonwealth, No. 1720-97-3 (Ct. of Appeals November 10, 1998). Where defendant was arrested for a probation violation, and then escaped, since defendant was not in custody for a misdemeanor, escape conviction would be reverse d. Khaliq v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (Va. Ct. App. May 7, 2002). Defendants escape from custody conviction was reversed, where the Commonwealth failed to show sufficient evidence that he was in the custody of the court when he failed to report to jail after being released on bond pending sentencing; thus, at the time he failed to report a sufficient restraint of physical control over him did not exist. Davis v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 12, 608 S.E.2d 482, 2005 Va. App. LE XIS 43 (2005). Where defendant failed to raise his objection before the trial court, the ends of justice exception was established because the record affirmatively demon strated that the...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-480"><akn:num>§ 18.2-480</akn:num><akn:heading>Escape, etc</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>, by setting fire to jail.

CASE NOTES Conviction under § 18.2-178 for inflated vendors bids.  The enactment of § 59.1-68.6 et seq. and this article did not preclude the Commonwealth from obtaining a conviction under § 18.2-178 of a defendant alleged to have improperly inflated vendors bids to the detriment of the Commonwealth, where the alleged acts took place prior to the enactment of the new statutes. Mosteller v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 143, 279 S.E.2d 380, 1981 Va. LEXIS 284 (1981). § 18.2-498.2. Definitions.

Injury. I.General Consideration. The focus of this section and § 18.2-500 is upon conspiracies resulting in business-related damages. Ward v. Connor, 495 F. Supp. 434, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14966 (E.D. Va. 1980), rev'd, 657 F.2d 45, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 18613 (4th Cir. 1981). The elements of a statutory conspiracy claim under the Virginia Conspiracy Act are: (1) concerted action; (2) legal malice; and (3) causally-related injury. Va. Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co.-Conn, 144 F. Supp. 2d 558, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7006 (W.D. Va. 2001), aff'd, 307 F.3d 277, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 20877 (4th Cir. 2002). Section not applicable to injury to ones employment interests.  Where former postmaster alleged that co-workers conspired to injure him in his reputation, trade, business and profession and as a result he was demoted, the clai m was dismissed for failure to state a claim for relief because this section addresses only injuries to ones business, not injuries to ones employment interests. Jordan v. Hudson, 690 F. Supp. 502, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7418 (E.D. Va. 1988), aff' d, 875 F.2d 315, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 6484 (4th Cir. 1989). To the extent a plaintiff attempts to base his conspiracy claim on injury to his personal reputation or employment, as opposed to business, interests, he fails to state a claim under this section and § 18.2-500. Warner v. Buck Creek Nursery, Inc., 149 F. Supp. 2d 246, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7025 (W.D. Va. 2001). The statute only applies to injury to a business, rather than merely to employment or employment reputation. Proffit v. Ring, No. 1:01CV00121, 2002 U.S. D ist. LEXIS 1316 (W.D. Va. Jan. 28, 2002). Where claims were brought for malicious prosecution and statutory conspiracy, under §§ 18.2-499 and 18.2-500, alleging conspiracy to injure reputation, trad e, business, and profession, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to defendants on the statutory conspiracy claims, as §§ 18.2-499 and 18.2-500 applied to business and property interests, not to personal or employment interests. Andrew s v. Ring, 266 Va. 311, 585 S.E.2d 780, 2003 Va. LEXIS 86 (2003). Physicians claimed injuries (the termination of the physicians employment with an anesthesiology group and a hospital and the potential difficulty the phy sician faced in obtaining future employment with another hospital or anesthesiology group) did not fall within the scope of §§ 18.2-499 and 18.2-500. Mansfield v. Anesthesia Assocs., No. 1:07cv941, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34732 (E.D. Va. Apr. 28, 200 8). Employment not within scope of section.  Summary judgment was granted for a defendant doctor who was chair of a hospital executive committee board and was alleged to be liable for a conspiracy under § § 18.2-499 and 18.2-500, because defendant could not be liable for a conspiracy arising from a personal employment relationship. Payman v. Mirza, No. 2:02CV00023, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21489 (W.D. Va. Nov. 1, 2002). Unspecified future business prospect insufficient to support claim.  This section does not apply to a claim of injury to an unspecified future business endeavor. Warner v. Buck Creek Nursery, Inc., 149 F. Supp. 2d 246, 2001 U.S. Di st. LEXIS 7025 (W.D. Va. 2001). Federal preemption.  Because copyright and the infringement thereof is an area controlled exclusively by the federal government, any state causes of action under this section and § 18.2-500 must be preempted in this area. Hoey v. Dexel Sys. Corp., 716 F. Supp. 222, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8839 (E.D. Va. 1989). Defendants business conspiracy and common law conspiracy claims would not be dismissed because applying the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Acts preemption provision would be premature as the court could not conclusively determine whether the information was a trade secret without the benefit of a factual record, and the court declined to enlarge the reach of the Uniform Trade Secrets Acts statutory pr eemption to include confidential business information. Microstrategy Servs. Corp. v. OpenRisk, LLC, No. 1:14cv1244, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32719 (E.D. Va. Mar. 17, 2015), dismissed in part, No. 1:14cv1244, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59347 (E.D. Va. May 6, 2015 ). Mandatory abstention where claim was related to bankruptcy proceeding.  Where plaintiffs claims for defamation and violation of the Virginia Business Conspiracy Act, § 18.2-499, were removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S. §§ 133 4(b) and 1452 on the ground that the claims were related to defendants bankruptcy proceeding, mandatory abstention was required under 28 U.S.C.S. § 1334(c)(2) because: (1) plaintiffs filed a timely motion to abstain; (2) the case was based on stat e law; (3) the proceeding did not arise under Title 11; (4) the case could not have been commenced in federal court absent 28 U.S.C.S. § 1334; (5) an action was commenced and could be timely adjudicated in state court; and (6) 28 U.S.C.S. § 157(b)( 4)s personal injury tort exception to mandatory abstention did not apply to claims that did not involve physical injury. Massey Energy Co. v. W. Va. Consumers for Justice, 351 Bankr. 348, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73695 (E.D. Va. 2006). Collateral estoppel.  Because legal malice standard applicable to this section is not identical to the willful and malicious standard required under the federal statute , debtor was not collaterally estopped from contesting issue of dischargeability of creditors claim arising from state court judgment. MT Tech. Enters., LLC v. Nolte, 542 Bankr. 185, 2015 Bankr. LEXIS 4013 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2015). Not preempted by Virginia Wine Franchise Act.  Virginia Wine Franchise Act did not preempt common-law or statutory conspiracy claims under § 18.2-499 by a wholesaler against a winery; a violation of the Act was covered by the Act, but a conspiracy to violate the Act was not. As the wholesaler had also brought an administrative proceeding before the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC Board), however, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction meant that the ABC Board should determine whether the wrongful acts underlying the conspiracy claims had occurred. Country Vintner, Inc. v. Louis Latour, Inc., 272 Va. 402, 634 S.E.2d 745, 2006 Va. LEXIS 86 (2006). Not preempted by Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act.  Plaintiff plainly articulated claims for conspiracy under § 18.2-499 that were independent of the claim for misappropriation of trade secrets and thus were not preempted under the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Kolon Indus., 688 F. Supp. 2d 443, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76795 (E.D. Va. 2009), . Choice of law.  Under Virginias doctrine of lex loci delicti, Georgia law governed plaintiffs claim for breach of Virginias business conspiracy statute, because the w rong alleged and the first causally related injury occurred in Georgia and the doctrine of legislative jurisdiction was inapplicable where plaintiff raised no constitutional challenge to the application of Virginias choice-of-law rules. Hilb Rogal &amp; Hobbs Co. v. Risk Strategy Partners, Inc., 230 Fed. Appx. 328, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 9332 (4th Cir. 2007). Dentists claims for violations of the Virginia Business Conspiracy Statute failed since District of Columbia law applied to the dentists tort claims under D.C.s modified governmental interests test since: (1) the injury occurred in D.C., resulting from conduct mostly occurring in Virginia; (2) the dentists resided in and did business in D.C.; (3) the former partner and his wife resided in Virginia and did ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_18.2-500"><akn:num>§ 18.2-500</akn:num><akn:heading>Same; civil relief; damages and counsel fees; injunctions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

The 2003 amendment by c. 578 substituted subsection designations A and B for subdivision designations (a) and (b); and in subsection A, substituted a comma for a semi-colon following plaintiffs counsel, and deleted the former last sentence, which read: Such counsel shall in no case receive any other, further or additional compensation except that allowed by the court and any contract to the contra ry shall be null and void. The 2005 amendments.

CASE NOTES The focus of § 18.2-499 and this section is upon conspiracies resulting in business-related damages. Ward v. Connor, 495 F. Supp. 434, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14966 (E.D. Va. 1980), rev'd, 657 F.2d 45, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 18613 (4th Cir. 1981). Section 18.2-499 not applicable to injury to ones employment interests.  Where former postmaster alleged that co-workers conspired to injure him in his reputation, trade, business and profession and as a result he was demoted, the clai m was dismissed for failure to state a claim for relief because § 18.2-499 addresses only injuries to ones business, not injuries to ones employment interests. Jordan v. Hudson, 690 F. Supp. 502, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7418 (E.D. Va. 1988), aff 'd, 875 F.2d 315, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 6484 (4th Cir. 1989). In a former employees suit against his former employer, alleging a civil conspiracy to divest him of his stock ownership in the employer and to injure his pro fessional reputation and business by terminating him, in violation of §§ 18.2-499 and 18.2-500, the employee failed to state a claim because his professional reputation and stock ownership in the company were employment interests, and not business interests, which were not covered by these laws. Inman v. Klockner-Pentaplast of Am., Inc., 467 F. Supp. 2d 642, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93620 (W.D. Va. 2006). Physicians claimed injuries (the termination of the physicians employment with an anesthesiology group and a hospital and the potential difficulty the phy sician faced in obtaining future employment with another hospital or anesthesiology group) did not fall within the scope of §§ 18.2-499 and 18.2-500. Mansfield v. Anesthesia Assocs., No. 1:07cv941, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34732 (E.D. Va. Apr. 28, 200 8). Federal preemption.  Because copyright and the infringement thereof is an area controlled exclusively by the federal government, any state causes of action under § 18.2-499 and thi s section must be preempted in this area. Hoey v. Dexel Sys. Corp., 716 F. Supp. 222, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8839 (E.D. Va. 1989). This section and 18 U. S.C.S. § 1961 et seq., compared.  The elements and purposes of Virginia business conspiracy statute, this section, and RICO, 18 U.S.C.S. § 1961 et seq., diverge. Where the Virginia act required a combination of two or more persons for the purpose of willfully and maliciously injuring plaintiff in his business, a RICO § 1962(c) cause of action is made out by proof of: (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity. Thus, the Virginia business conspiracy act is not an appropriate state statute from which to borrow a statute of limitations for RICO. HMK Corp. v. Walsey, 637 F. Supp. 710, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24490 (E.D. Va. 1986), aff'd, 828 F.2d 1071, 19 87 U.S. App. LEXIS 12363 (4th Cir. 1987). Exclusive distributorship arrangements do not violate the antitrust laws unless they for eclose competition in the relevant market. Thompson Everett, Inc. v. National Cable Adv., 850 F. Supp. 470, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5168 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd, 57 F.3d 1317, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 15835 (4th Cir. 1995). This statutory action provides a remedy for wrongful conduct directed to the business. A n injury to ones business is clearly an injury to ones property interest. Federated Graphics Cos. v. Napotnik, 424 F. Supp. 291, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12285 (E.D. Va. 1976); Picture Lake Campground, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 497 F. Supp. 858, 1 980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12822 (E.D. Va. 1980), disapproved, Phillips v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 792 F.2d 521, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 26291 (5th Cir. 1986). The elements of a statutory conspiracy claim under the Virginia Conspiracy Act are: (1) concerted action; (2) legal malice; and (3) causally-related injury. Va. Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co.-Conn, 144 F. Supp. 2d 558, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7006 (W.D. Va. 2001), aff'd, 307 F.3d 277, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 20877 (4th Cir. 2002). Elements of a statutory civil conspiracy claim require a plaintiff to allege that two or more persons combined, associated, agreed, or mutually undertook together to willfully and maliciously injure the plaintiff in his reputation, trade, business, or profession; a district court erred when it dismissed a real estate brokers statutory conspiracy claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) because the broker ha d sufficiently alleged: (1) that a limited liability company and its agents had conspired and acted together to complete the sale of a farm without paying the broker a commission for the work that it had performed in connection with the sale; (2) that th e conduct of the company and its agents was intentional, purposeful, and without lawful justification; and (3) that the conduct resulted in substantial monetary damages to the broker. T.G. Slater &amp; Son v. Donald P. &amp; Patricia A. Brennan LLC, 385 F.3d 836 , 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 20572 (4th Cir. 2004). Elements of offense.  To recover in an action for conspiracy to harm a business, the plaintiff must prove: (1) a combination of two or more persons for the purpose of willfully and mal iciously injuring plaintiff in his business; and (2) resulting damage to plaintiff. Allen Realty Corp. v. Holbert, 227 Va. 441, 318 S.E.2d 592, 1984 Va. LEXIS 212 (1984); Meadow Ltd. Partnership v. Heritage Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 639 F. Supp. 643, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23107 (E.D. Va. 1986). In order to prove a conspiracy under the Virginia Conspiracy Act, at least two people had to have combined intentionally for the nefarious purpose of harming the victims business, but unfortunately for debtor, it did not make it over this initial hurdle. The only remaining defendant could not conspire alone. Wellington Apt., LLC v. Clotworthy (In re Wellington Apt., LLC), No. 04-50301-DHA, No. APN 05-5029, 20 06 Bankr. LEXIS 1954 (Bankr. E.D. Va. July 27, 2006), reprinted, 350 Bankr. 213, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 2362 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2006). Company failed to present any evidence either of a conspiracy between the corporation and the non-minority owned company or legal malice on behalf of either; ther efore, any injury the company might have suffered was not actionable under the Virginia Business Conspiracy Act, §§ 18.2-499 and 18.2-500. DAG Petroleum Suppliers, L.L.C. v. BP P.L.C., 268 Fed. Appx. 236, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 1293 (4th Cir. 2008). Proof of malice required.  The element of legal malice requires the plaintiff to prove that the concerted action was undertaken by one conspirator to injure the plaintiff intentionally, pur posefully and without lawful justification, but the statute does not require that the the co-conspirator act with legal malice; rather, the statute simply requires that one party, acting with legal malice, conspire with another party to injure the plaint iff. Va. Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co.-Conn, 144 F. Supp. 2d 558, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7006 (W.D. Va. 2001), aff'd, 307 F.3d 277, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 20877 (4th Cir. 2002). To prove malice, plaintiffs must show that defendants acted intentionally, purposefully, and without legal justification; significantly, the statute does not requ ire a plaintiff to prove that a conspirators primary and overriding purpose is to injure another in his trade or business. Atlas Partners II v. Brumberg, Mackey &amp; Wall, PLC, No. 4:05CV00001, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 983 (W.D. Va. Jan. 6, 2006).

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 6B M.J. Embezzlement, § 12. CASE NOTES Conspiracy between corporation and its agents as legal impossibility.  Although plaintiffs allegations were initially sufficient to satisfy the threshold demands of Virginias civil conspiracy statute, they were not sufficient to overcome the obstacle provided by the intracorporate immunity doctrine, which holds that because at least two persons must be present to form a conspiracy, a corporation cannot conspire with itself; therefore, a conspiracy between a corporation and t he agents of that corporation who are acting in the scope of their employment is a legal impossibility. Selman v. American Sports Underwriters, Inc., 697 F. Supp. 225, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11446 (W.D. Va. 1988). Waiver of immunity.  This section does not operate to withdraw subject matter jurisdiction. Rather, it affords the defense of immunity, and immunity may of course be waived by failure to invoke the immunity when prosecution is begun. Evans v.
