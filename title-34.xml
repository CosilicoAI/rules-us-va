CASE NOTES Purpose.  This section, even after the 1978 and 1979 amendments, continues to meet its original purported purpose to conserve the family home (shelter) from forced sales. I n re Thompson, 4 Bankr. 823, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11972 (E.D. Va. 1980). Intent of 1978 and 1979 amendments.  The Virginia legislature in its amendments of this section in 1978 and 1979 intended that single persons maintaining a separate residence, and persons separated o r divorced from their spouses and maintaining a separate residence, should be entitled to an exemption and this entitlement would be without regard to whether, upon establishing a separate residence, such persons also assumed the mantle of head of th e household; however, the legislature did not intend to grant double exemptions where there was only one residence occupied by two people. In re Thompson, 4 Bankr. 823, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11972 (E.D. Va. 1980); In re Doan, 11 Bankr. 704, 1981 Bank r. LEXIS 3508 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981). How federa l court must interpret Virginia exemptions.  Because Congress has the power under the Constitution to establish uniform bankruptcy laws, and has enacted a specific provision for exemptions, 11 U.S.C. § 52 2, a federal court must adopt an interpretation of Virginias law with respect to exemptions that does not conflict with the Bankruptcy Acts exemption provision. Cheeseman v. Nachman, 656 F.2d 60, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 10915 (4th Cir. 1981). Exemption involving in tentional tort allowed.  Because Congress specifically legislated as to the type of claims that can be enforced against exempt property, and since the plaintiffs claim did not fall wi thin any of the enumerated exceptions, the court concluded that the debtor was entitled to her exemptions notwithstanding that the plaintiff held a nondischargeable claim based on an intentional tort. In re Scott, 199 Bankr. 586, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 1041 ( Bankr. E.D. Va. 1996). Relation to wage exemption.  With respect to debtors deferred compensation plan (partner equity plan), debtors claim of exemption of 75 percent of distribution from plan was proper be cause distribution that debtor was entitled to receive from partner equity plan qualified as earnings under definition contained in statute and exemption meant protection from all forms of creditor process whether or not there was pending garnishment at time of bankruptcy filing. In re Foster, 556 Bankr. 233, 2016 Bankr. LEXIS 2963 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2016). The homestead exemption by its express terms is made available to any resident of Virginia, without regard to whether such person is a wage earner. In re Fromal, 151 Bankr. 730, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20852 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, 14 F.3d 594, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 5029 (4th Cir. 1994). Creditor process inapplicable where debtor is a secured creditor.  The exemption from creditor process set forth in § 34-28.1 with respect to the proceeds of a personal injury settlement did not apply to the equitable lien a subrogated ERISA plan had against the proceeds of a beneficiarys settlement, since that lien gave the plan a security interest in the proceeds of the settlement. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Carpenter (In re Carpenter), 252 Bankr. 905, 2000 U.S. D ist. LEXIS 13797 (E.D. Va. 2000), aff'd, 36 Fed. Appx. 80, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 10615 (4th Cir. 2002). Debtor had a motive for concealment when valuing his claim or failing to amend the schedules after he filed a personal injury action against a corporation because his unsecured debt was $534,000, his secured debt was $762,000, the exemption statute, § 34-28.1, did not apply where the lienholder was secured, and, thus, his secured creditors would have been able to collect on any award or settlement recovered by him; therefore, he was judicially estopped from seeking more than $1 million in damages against the corporation when he listed the personal injury claim as $1 million on his schedules. Payne v. Wyeth Pharms., Inc., 606 F. Supp. 2d 613, 2008 U.S. Dist. L EXIS 106938 (E.D. Va. 2008). The statutory definition of householder is vague and ambiguous. Shaia v. Marsh, 2 6 Bankr. 94, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5182 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). The legislature intended to make clear that the word householder should not be restricted as to the marital status nor place or abode or presence of other persons therein as an eliminating feature of the right to claim a homestead exemption. Dickens v. Snellings, 10 Bankr. 949, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3787 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981).  Householder and head of family are convertible terms.  The terms householder and head of the family are convertible terms, and are employed as explanatory the one of the other. They involve the idea of dependence and support, coupled with a legal or moral obligation to support the dependent. Oppenheim v. Myers, 99 Va. 582, 39 S.E. 218, 1901 Va. LEXIS 82 (1901). Although this section defines householder and not head of family, these terms have been considered equivalent. Cheeseman v. Nachman, 656 F.2d 60, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 10915 (4th Cir. 1981). The language shall include should not be considered a limitation but should be c onsidered an extension or enlargement of the definition householder. Dickens v. Snellings, 10 Bankr. 949, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3787 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981). The phrase whether or not others are living with him found in this section (whic h was added by the 1978 amendment to this section) is clearly intended only to drop the long-standing requirement that in order for a person to be a householder he must have dependents. In re Doan, 11 Bankr. 704, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3508 (Bankr. E. D. Va. 1981). A husband and wife, living together, may both be deemed householders under the definitio n in this section. Cheeseman v. Nachman, 656 F.2d 60, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 10915 (4th Cir. 1981). If he or she contributes to the maintenance of the household. Cheeseman v. Nachman, 656 F .2d 60, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 10915 (4th Cir. 1981); In re Gustinis, 16 Bankr. 108, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 2396 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981). In light of the ambiguities in the householder definition and of strong policy considerations, this section can and should be read to allow a homestead exemption to each spouse living together if he or she contributes to the maintenance of the household. Roberts v. County of Henrico Fed. Credit Union, 709 F.2d 275, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 26893 (4th Cir. 1983). Allowing only one householder per residence would conflict with bankruptcy laws.  A construction of Virginia law that allows only one householder per residence, would be inconsistent with § 522(m) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 11 U.S .C. § 101 et seq., which must be interpreted as allowing each debtor in a joint case to take some exemptions, whether the amount is determined by state or federal law. Cheeseman v. Nachman, 656 F.2d 60, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 10915 (4th Cir. 1981). A wife who filed a joint voluntary petition in bankruptcy with her husband was a householder within the meaning of this section, and was therefore entitled to a h omestead exemption in addition to her husbands, where they were married to each other and living together at the time of filing. Cheeseman v. Nachman, 656 F.2d 60, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 10915 (4th Cir. 1981). Where debtors were married and living together, and only the husband was employed, and w here they were not each maintaining a separate residence or living quarters, under the applicable Virginia law the wife did not meet the definition of a householder and was not entitled to the homestead exemption in the bankruptcy proceeding. In re Thompson, 4 Bankr. 823, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11972 (E.D. Va. 1980). Unmarried de btors living together to pool resources.  Two unmarried debtors were not maintaining a separate residence or living quarters and, therefore, did not qualify as householders under this section and could not claim the exemptions provided under § 34-4, where the debtors resided together in a dwelling they owned as joint tena...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_34-2"><akn:num>§ 34-2</akn:num><akn:heading>Injunction restraining sale of exempted property or garnishment of wages</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text An injunction may be awarded to enjoin the sale of any property exempt under the provisions of this title, and to prevent the wages exempted by § 34-29 from being ga rnisheed or otherwise collected by an execution creditor.

For related discussion, see 2C M.J. Bankruptcy, §§ 72, 76. CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  This section is constitutional. In re White, 11 Bankr. 775, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3777 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981). Residents of Virginia filing bankruptcy petitions may claim only those exemptions allowa ble under state law and general (nonbankruptcy) Federal law. In re Massey, 225 Bankr. 887, 1998 Bankr. LEXIS 1338 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1998). This section does not offend 11 U.S.C.S. § 522. It was specifically allowed by 11 U.S .C.S. § 522(b)(1). In re White, 11 Bankr. 775, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3777 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981). By the wording of this section, it is clear that this title is the applicable law with regard to exemptions permitted under Section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.S. § 522). Simmons v. Peoples Bank, 27 Bankr. 508, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 6785 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1983). Limitation on opting out.  The authority for this opting out statute, 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(1), does not give the states the power to opt out of § 522 in its entirety, but allows opting out only with respect to the federal exemptions. Bass v. Thacker, 5 Bankr. 592, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 4671 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). This opting out statute is clearly limited by its language to excluding only the federal exemptions specified in § 522(d). Bass v. Thacker, 5 Bankr. 59 2, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 4671 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). Only 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(d), the specific provision relating to the federal exemption scheme, is not law in Virginia. There is no effect on the so-called lie n avoidance §§ 522(e) and (f). F &amp; M Bank v. Boyd, 11 Bankr. 690, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3549 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981). Failure to comply with homestead statute precludes exemption in bankruptcy.  Failure of a debtor to comply with the Virginia homestead exemption statute precludes him from claiming that exemption for bankruptcy purposes. Zimmerman v. Morga n, 689 F.2d 471, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 26036 (4th Cir. 1982). Virginia has opted-out of the federal exemption scheme and Virginia debtors may only assert Virginia exemptions, including the homestead exemption. In re Calhoun, 47 Bankr. 119, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6687 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). This section allows Virginia residents to use only the exemptions created under state law. In order for a Virginia debtor to avoid a lien pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(f)(1) or (2), therefore, the debtor must be entitled to an exemption under state law. Shearer v. Crestar Bank, 132 Bankr. 313, 1991 Bankr. LEXIS 2048 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1991). A state may by statute opt out of allowing its residents to take advantage of the federal exemptions, which the state has done, and accordingly, residents of the state filing bankruptcy petitions may claim only those exemptions allowable under state law and general federal law. In re Scott, 199 Bankr. 586, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 1041 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1996). Because the Commonwealth of Virginia has opted out of the federal exemption scheme, a debtor must claim his exemptions in compliance with Virginia law. Mayer v. Q uy Van Nguyen (In re Quy Van Nguyen), 211 F.3d 105, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 8271 (4th Cir. 2000). Under § 34-3.1, Virginia has opted out of the federal bankruptcy exemptions, and consequently, in Virginia, debtors may only claim those exemptions allowed und er 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(2). In re Zaidi, 293 Bankr. 861, 2002 Bankr. LEXIS 1721 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2002). Keogh plan.  A bankruptcy debtors tax-qualified self-employment Keogh retirement plan was not exempt. Parkinson v. Bradford Trust Co. (In re O'Brien), 50 Bankr. 67, 1985 B ankr. LEXIS 6212 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). Virginia homestead e xemptions still available.  Although Virginia opted out of the federal exemptions of 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(d), the exemptions claimed by a Virginia debtor under the Virginia homestead laws ar e still protected by the debtors ability under 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(f) to avoid judgment liens and nonpossessory nonpurchase money security interests in certain household and personal goods to the extent of the exemptions allowable under Virginia law . Beneficial Fin. Co. v. Rodgers, 5 Bankr. 761, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 4496 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980), disapproved, Sumy v. Schlossberg, 777 F.2d 921, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 24209 (4th Cir. 1985). Exempt property no t includible as creditor asset.  Where the debtors had claimed their exemptions pursuant to Virginia law, creditors attempt to include exempt property on the asset side was unavailing. Babike r v. Citizens Contracting Co., 180 Bankr. 458, 1995 Bankr. LEXIS 464 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995). Power to avoid interests contained in 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(f) operates independently of states choice regarding its exemption scheme. O'Malley v. Rapidan River Farm, 24 Bankr. 900, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15829 (E.D. Va. 1982). Exemptions allowed where debtors were state residents at time of filing homestead deed.  Debtors, residents of the Commonwealth, who shipped all of their household goods out-of-state, subsequently filed a homestead deed in Virginia and then moved to F lorida while their attorney filed petitions in bankruptcy in Virginia, were allowed their requested exemptions since they were residents of Virginia at the time of the homestead deed filing. In re Chaffins, 16 Bankr. 686, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5127 (Bankr. E .D. Va. 1982). Personal injury suits filed by bankrupt debtor prior to ex emption were nullities and did not toll the statute of limitations.  Accident victim lacked standing to file any of the three personal injury suits he filed against a driver because he had filed for bankruptcy, and the cause of act ion could only be asserted by the trustee. The victims action was a nullity, and the statute of limitations had run before it was filed, pursuant to § 8.01-243. Kocher v. Campbell, 282 Va. 113, 712 S.E.2d 477, 2011 Va. LEXIS 133, cert. denied, 565 U.S. 1093, 132 S. Ct. 847, 181 L. Ed. 2d 549, 2011 U.S. LEXIS 8861 (2011). Property coming into estate after bankruptcy petition filed.  Former Bankruptcy Rule 110 affects a debtors procedural rights only and cannot overcome restrictions imposed or permitted by substantive provisions of the Ban kruptcy Code such as § 522(b)(1) (allowing states to opt out of the federal exemption scheme). Debtors in other states may be able to claim as exempt property coming into the estate after a petition is filed. Bankruptcy Code § 522(b)(1) and this section and § 34-17, however, operate to bar Virginia debtors from doing so in this jurisdiction. Collins v. Peyton, 24 Bankr. 485, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 2960 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). Waiver of exemptions.  Because the debtors did not claim their exemptions until 13 days following the date scheduled for the first meeting of creditors, under § 34-17, those exemptio ns were waived.

At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, 23.1-707 was substituted for 23-38.81 to conform to the recodification of Title 23 by Acts 2016 , c. 588, effective October 1, 2016. Acts 2020, c. 328, cl. 2 provides: That the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia shall promulgate and update the forms necessary to comply wi th the provisions of the first enactment of this act. The 1997 amendments.

I.General Consideration. This title gave effect to Article 14 of former Constitution.  Article 14 of the former Constitution of Virginia, relating to homestead exemptions, was not self-executing, but was carried into effect by this title. Oppenheim v. Myers, 99 Va. 582, 39 S.E. 218, 1901 Va. LEXIS 82 (1901). It is to b e liberally construed.  The homestead provisions must be liberally construed. Wilkinson v. Merrill, 87 Va. 513, 12 S.E. 1015, 1891 Va. LEXIS 102 (1891); Oppenheim v. Myers, 99 Va. 582, 3 9 S.E. 218, 1901 Va. LEXIS 82 (1901); Brown's Comm. v. Western State Hosp., 110 Va. 321, 66 S.E. 48, 1909 Va. LEXIS 146 (1909). A remedial statute such as this one must be construed liberally so as to afford all the relief within the power of the court which the language of the statute ind icates that the legislature intended. Dickens v. Snellings, 10 Bankr. 949, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3787 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981). With reference to homestead exemptions, courts employ the most liberal and humane rules of interpretation to insure the unfortunate debtor and his equally unfortu nate but more helpless family, the shelter and influence of the object which the exemption provides. Dickens v. Snellings, 10 Bankr. 949, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3787 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981). Exemption statutes are to be liberally construed in favor of the party asserting the exemption privilege; however, courts are neither to reduce nor enlarge the ex emptions or read into the law an exemption not found there. In re Williams, 3 Bankr. 244, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5455 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1980). It is the almost universal rule that exemption statutes should receive a liberal construction in favor of those intended to be benefited and favorable to the obje ct and purposes of the enactment, and where there is doubt as to whether certain property is exempt or not, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the exemption. In re Perry, 6 Bankr. 263, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 4409 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). Courts in Virginia are required to liberally construe statutes relating to homestead laws in favor of debtors in order to protect the debtors and their families. In re Smith, 22 Bankr. 866, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 3422 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). Courts must liberally construe the law pertaining to homestead deeds in favor of debtors. Furthermore, any ambiguities found in state exemption laws must be resol ved in favor of debtors. In re Redmon, 31 Bankr. 756, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 5960 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1983). Courts should construe liberally the law pertaining to homestead deeds in favor of debtors. The law is equally clear, however, that there are certain strict requi rements in a bankruptcy setting which must be observed. Homeowner's Fin. Corp. v. Pennington, 47 Bankr. 322, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6508 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). The Virginia homestead exemption is intended to shield helpless and unfortunate debtors and their families from the onslaught of creditors, and consequently must be liberally construed so as to afford the relief which the legislature intended the debtor to enjoy. In re Hayes, 119 Bankr. 86, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2030 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1990). In considering the issue of whether creditors post-discharge actions taken with regard to exempt property which secured the underlying debt violated federal p rovisions of permanent injunction, the same rule of liberally construing a federal remedial statute in favor of the debtor is recognized in Virginia as it pertains to the Virginia exemption statutes. Martin v. AVCO Fin. Servs., 157 Bankr. 268, 1993 Bankr . LEXIS 1203 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1993). The homestead exemption by its express terms is made available to any resident of Virginia, without regard to whether such person is a wage earner. In re Fromal, 151 Bankr. 730, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20852 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, 14 F.3d 594, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 5029 (4th Cir. 1994). Purposes of homestead exemptions are two-fold. First, they protect debtors from being le ft destitute from creditor process by allowing debtors to retain stakeholds. Second, by requiring a homestead deed to be filed in the jurisdiction in which the debtor resides, it enables creditors to ascertain by inspection whether the debtor is underest imating the value of the property he claims exempt, thereby keeping to himself property that should be subjected to the payment of his debts. In re Smith, 22 Bankr. 866, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 3422 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). The homestead is a shield to protect the helpless and unfortunate debtor from the import unate and incompassionate creditor. Linkenhoker v. Detrick, 81 Va. 44, 1885 Va. LEXIS 8 (1885); Barker v. Jenkins, 84 Va. 895, 6 S.E. 459, 1888 Va. LEXIS 162 (1888). The homestead provision was intended to give protection to the unfortunate as against debts contracted, and not to fortify the crafty and designing agains t the consequences of their wrongdoing. Burton v. Mill, 78 Va. 468, 1884 Va. LEXIS 22 (1884). Section 20-107.3 does not apply to a determination of whether a debtor may claim an exem ption under this section in property owned by her spouse prior to marriage. In re Wilkinson, 100 Bankr. 315, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 1141 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1989). Privilege is personal to householder.  The privilege, so far as it was given by the Constitution, is personal to the householder.

Fraudulent Conveyances. VI. Rent. I.General Consideration. The plain language of this section prohibits the claim of an exemption in property again st a debt for the purchase price of that property. In re Johnson, 179 Bankr. 800, 1995 Bankr. LEXIS 455 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995). Not ap plicable to judgment liens.  The Virginia homestead exemption is not applicable to judgment liens for wages. Davis v. Lester, 97 Bankr. 292, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 353 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1989). Exemption involving intentional tort allowed.  Because Congress specifically legislated as to the type of claims that can be enforced against exempt property, and since the plaintiffs claim did not fall wi thin any of the enumerated exceptions, the court concluded that the debtor was entitled to her exemptions notwithstanding that the plaintiff held a nondischargeable claim based on an intentional tort. In re Scott, 199 Bankr. 586, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 1041 ( Bankr. E.D. Va. 1996). II.Purchase Price. Exemptions under both §§ 34-4 and 34-26 cannot be claimed against debts for the pu rchase price of the property, or for any part of the purchase price. In re Johnson, 179 Bankr. 800, 1995 Bankr. LEXIS 455 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995). Demand for purchase money is superior to homestead exemption.  Homestead exemptions do not extend to any execution, order or other process issued on any demand for payment of the purchase money due upon the goods. Wray v. Dav enport, 79 Va. 19, 1884 Va. LEXIS 54 (1884). To extent of market value of goods.  The market value of so much of the goods on hand and not paid for at the time of a debtors death is the full measure of the sellers recovery superior to t he claim of homestead of the debtors infant children. Edgewood Distilling Co. v. Rosser, 116 Va. 624, 82 S.E. 716, 1914 Va. LEXIS 71 (1914). Bankrupt must identify unpaid-for goods.  It is the duty of a bankrupt who wishes to take advantage of the homestead exemption to identify and designate the goods on which, in whole or in part, he still o wes the purchase money, in order that the trustee may set apart as exempt such as have been paid for. If the bankrupt is unable to do this, having so intermingled the goods for which he has not paid with others that have been paid for as to make it impos sible to designate the class for which he still owes, no homestead can be set apart in any of the goods. In re Tobias, 103 F. 68, 1900 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 301 (D. Va. 1900). Or no exemption will be allowed.  Where a large portion of goods claimed as exempt has not been paid for, and is so mingled with those that have been as to put it out of the power of the vendors t o distinguish between the two, the onus is on the person claiming the exemption to show which has been paid for; and he failing to do this, they will all be treated as not having been paid for, as far as the homestead deed is concerned, and therefore not exempt under the law. Rose v. Sharpless &amp; Son, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 153, 1880 Va. LEXIS 28 (1880). In a case in which a debtor appealed a bankruptcy courts determination that she was not entitled to avoid a judicial lien under 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(f), since she had not claimed an exemption in the residential property subject to the lien, § 522(f) did not require that a debtor actually claim an exemption in the property subject to a judicial lien; instead, the statute only required that the lien impair a n exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under subsection (b) in the absence of any liens. Under § 34-5, the debtor had been precluded from claiming a homestead exemption in her residential property. Botkin v. Dupont Cmty. Credit Union , 432 Bankr. 230, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48164 (W.D. Va. 2010), aff'd, 650 F.3d 396, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 11974 (4th Cir. 2011). And burden o f proving payment is on him.  In bankruptcy proceedings, where the creditors except to the report of the trustee setting apart the bankrupts homestead exemption under § 34-4, on the gro und that the articles claimed as exempt have not been paid for, the burden of proving that the articles have been paid for should rest on the bankrupt. In re Campbell, 124 F. 417, 1903 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147 (D. Va. 1903). Any creditor may except to the allowance of a homestead exemption to a bankrupt on the g round that the goods set apart have not been paid for, without showing that the excepting creditor is the vendor of the goods, because, under the federal bankruptcy law, every creditor shares pro rata in the fund that may be saved to the estate by such o bjection. In re Campbell, 124 F. 417, 1903 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147 (D. Va. 1903). Where the creditor is not pursuing an action for the purchase price of its collateral, i t is not entitled to the protection of subdivision 1. Dominion Bank v. Nuckolls, 780 F.2d 408, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 25728 (4th Cir. 1985). Where creditor gave debtor a check for the price of a new car made out to the dealership, this section was not applicable and did not invalidate debtors exemption on the basis that debtor had not paid the purchase price for the car, since creditor merely made a personal loan to debtor and the automobile dealership was the actual vendor. Jones v. Kirsch, 93 Bankr. 77, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16234 (E.D. Va. 1988). Failure to perfect security interest of no import.  Pursuant to this section, the poor debtors exemption cannot be claimed against a debt for the purchase price of property or any part thereof; thus, cr editors failure to perfect its security interest in debtors car had no bearing. In re Bonner, 206 Bankr. 387, 1997 Bankr. LEXIS 409 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1997). III.Liabilities Incurred by Officer, Fiduciary, or Attorney for Money Collected. Former exemption applied to collector of taxes and hi s sureties.  The former third exemption embraced the liabilities of a collector of taxes and also of his sureties in his official bond. And therefore the sureties were not ent itled to their homestead exemption as against the Commonwealth in a proceeding against them and their principal to recover the amount of taxes for which the collector had failed to account. Commonwealth v. Ford, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 683, 1878 Va. LEXIS 5 ( 1878). Fiduciary liabilities.  Where the complainant agreed that the defendant should have one-third of the profits of the resale of land purchased at a judicial sale, although there arose from the transaction a fiduciary relationship and not a mere contract of employment, the complainant was not such a fiduciary as was contemplated by former subdivision (3) of this section. Therefore a recital in the decree, against the complainant, that  homestead exemption waived by reason of the fact that this is a fiduciary debt due from the complainant to the defendant, was improper. Alexander v. Critcher, 121 Va. 723, 94 S.E. 335, 1917 Va. LEXIS 71 (1917). Judgment rendered against a convicted defendant for court costs in a criminal case is no t rendered on any demand for a debt or liability contracted by him. Wicks v. City of Charlottesville, 215 Va. 274, 208 S.E.2d 752, 1974 Va. LEXIS 273 (1974). IV.Shifting Stock of Merchandi se. A stock of merchandise ceases to be shifting upon the death of the owner thereof, and be comes fixed and stable, and it or the proceeds of the sale thereof may be subject to the claim of homestead by the infant children of the former owner. Edgewood Distilling Co. v. Rosser, 116 Va. 624, 82 S.E. 716, 1914 Va. LEXIS 71 (1914). A failing debtor cannot transmute a shifting stock of merchandise not exempt into exempt property by withdrawing it from sale for the purpose of claiming it as an exemption. Laderburg v. Miller, 210 F. 614, 1913 U.S. App. LEXIS 1918 (4th Cir. 1913). Destruction by fire or other casualty.  When a shifting stock of merchandise was absolutely destroyed by fire, the stock not only ceased to be shifting, but ceased to exist, and the claim of the owner t o money due under his contract of insurance became fixed and stable. The claim was not to a shifting stock of merchandise; it was specifically for money and debts due, a classification of property entitled to be claimed as exempt. Goldburg Co. v. Salyer, 188 Va. 573, 50 S.E.2d 272, 1948 Va. LEXIS 191 (1948).

CASE NOTES Purpose of deed of homestead.  The deed of homestead is merely designed to set apart and designate the portions of his property which the owner claims to hold exempt from seizure and sale under any execution, order or other legal process, and to give notice of it to the world. White v. Owen, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 43, 1878 Va. LEXIS 48 (1878); Linkenhoker v. Detrick, 81 Va. 44, 1885 Va. LEXIS 8 (1885). The homestead exemption is independent of, and may be claimed in addition to, other avai lable exemptions. In re Cathcart, 203 Bankr. 599, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 1526 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1996). There is no statutory requirement to file a copy of the Homestead Deed in the active cas e file. In re Preston, 96 Bankr. 61, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 147 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1989). Effect of failure to set apart hom estead.  If a party claiming an exemption fails to select and set apart the property which he is entitled to hold, he has failed to avail himself of the right he was entit led to hold in such property, and his right of exemption, if not exercised before sale, is gone. Reed v. Union Bank, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 719, 1878 Va. LEXIS 9 (1878). Claim in sched ule filed by bankrupt is insufficient.  The mere act of a bankrupt in claiming a homestead exemption in the schedule filed by him is not a compliance with this section. In re Garner, 115 F. 200, 1902 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 211 (D. Va. 1902). Value of exempted prop erty improperly claimed.  Bankruptcy debtor improperly claimed exemptions by listing the value of the exempted property as 100 percent of the fair market value of the property, since § § 34-6 and 34-14 strictly required that the debtor state a dollar amount of the value of the exempt property and the exemption, and the debtors non-numerical values did not satisfy the requirement. In re Stoney, 445 Bankr. 543, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 5 66 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2011). Where the homestead deed is to be recorded depends on the nature of the property, i.e., realty or personalty. If the property is realty, the homestead deed must be filed in the county of the jurisdiction where the land is located. If personalty, the homestead deed must be filed in the county where the debtors reside. In re Calhoun, 47 Bankr . 119, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6687 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). A Virginia debtor having an interest in real estate located outside of Virginia must nev ertheless comply with the requirements of this section and file a homestead deed in the jurisdiction where the property is situate. In re Calhoun, 47 Bankr. 119, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6687 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). With respect to real property, a debtor must record a signed writing  the Homestead Deed for Real Property  which adequately describes the property and th e debtors intentions, and which must be recorded as deeds are recorded, in the county or city wherein such real estate or any part thereof is located; Virginia law is also clear that debtors who claim an interest in property located outside o f Virginia must comply strictly with the homestead exemption recording requirements by filing a homestead deed in the appropriate jurisdiction wherein the property is located. In re Heater, 189 Bankr. 629, 1995 Bankr. LEXIS 1802 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995). Bankruptcy court sustained the trustees objection to the claimed homestead exemption due to debtors failure to file his homestead deed in compliance with § 34-6. In re McWilliams, 296 Bankr. 424, 2002 Bankr. LEXIS 1215 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2002). Chapter 13 trustees objection to a homestead exemption was sustained because the debtor, who resided in Virginia, did not strictly comply with § 34-6 by fi ling a homestead deed in the North Carolina county where the property was located and admitted that a homestead deed would have been accepted for recording there. In re Mackie, No. 05-53293-A, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 812 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Apr. 19, 2006). Erroneous filing disallowed despite good faith, diligence and reasonable effort.  Where a homestead deed is filed in the wrong county, the exemption must be disallowed, although good faith, diligence, and reasonable effort was made to properly file and record the homestead deed. A court must apply this rule despite the fact that cases uniformly have held that statutes creating debtors exemptions must be liberally construed in favor of the debtor and the exemption. Despite that general prin ciple, there is no exception where the homestead deed is filed in an erroneous location. In re Tate, 41 Bankr. 946, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 5259 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1984). Effect of noncomplianc e with local county rule.  Where Chapter 7 debtors timely delivered properly executed homestead deeds with fees paid to the county setting the property apart as exempt pursuant to §§ 34-6 and 34-17, but the debtors did not comply with a local county rule until the time period under § 34-17 had expired, the county rule did not render the claimed exemption void because enforcement of the local rule would have been inconsistent with the statutory provisions for claiming exemptions under Title 34 of the Virginia Code and would also have abridged the substantive rights of the debtors.

For related discussion, see 8A M.J. Exemptions from Executions and Attachments, § 13. CASE NOTES Analysis I. General Consideration. II. Bankruptcy Proceedings. I.General Consideration. Section is const itutional.  This section is a reasonable exercise of the power granted the legislature under § 192 of the former Constitution to prescribe the conditions under which exemp t property may be held. Wray v. Davenport, 79 Va. 19, 1884 Va. LEXIS 54 (1884). Purposes of homestead exemptions are two-fold. First, they protect debtors from being le ft destitute from creditor process by allowing debtors to retain stakeholds. Second, by requiring a homestead deed to be filed in the jurisdiction in which the debtor resides, it enables creditors to ascertain by inspection whether the debtor is underest imating the value of the property he claims exempt, thereby keeping to himself property that should be subjected to the payment of his debts. In re Smith, 22 Bankr. 866, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 3422 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). The homestead exemption is not absolute. It exists only when and after the debtor has cl aimed it and perfected it by recordation in the clerks office of an instrument setting forth his claim and giving a description and valuation of the property claimed as homestead. Until the debtor has taken the steps prescribed by this section, he is not entitled to any homestead exemption. In re Robinette, 34 F. Supp. 518, 1932 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1418 (D. Va. 1932). This section must be complied with.  Where a statute prescribes a particular method to be adopted with respect to the claiming, selecting and setting apart of the homestead, its provisions must be co mplied with, since the entire right to homestead exemption depends on statutory authority. Wray v. Davenport, 79 Va. 19, 1884 Va. LEXIS 54 (1884). Until the debtor has taken the steps prescribed by this section, he is not entitled to any homestead exemption. In re Robinette, 34 F. Supp. 518, 1932 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1418 (D. Va. 1932). Setting apart includes admitting the homestead deed to record. Only after a home stead deed is properly admitted to record does the clerks duty arise to record it in deed book. In re Nguyen, 226 Bankr. 547, 1998 Bankr. LEXIS 1412 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1998), aff'd, 211 F.3d 105, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 8271 (4th Cir. 2000). When the clerk receives the homestead deed in proper form with fees paid on a date well before the fifth day after the creditors meeting, the exemption has be en claimed in a timely manner even though the deed is not admitted to record until some day after that. Mayer v. Quy Van Nguyen (In re Quy Van Nguyen), 211 F.3d 105, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 8271 (4th Cir. 2000). Homestead deed recorded in the wrong county is ineffective. Shirkey v. Leake, 715 F.2d 85 9, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 24584 (4th Cir. 1983). The claim to a homestead must be made either by deed or by inventory, and it is not suff icient to set it up in a bill, or for counsel to ask for it in a note of argument. Wray v. Davenport, 79 Va. 19, 1884 Va. LEXIS 54 (1884). Purpose of description and valuation.  The requirement of this section that the debtor designate and describe each parcel or article set apart, and affix to each his cash valuation thereof, is a wise a nd reasonable one. Its purpose is to enable creditors to ascertain, by inspection of the different articles and the prices affixed thereto, whether the debtor is making a fair and honest claim of homestead, or whether he is giving an underestimate of its value, and thereby securing to himself property that should be subjected to the payment of his debts. In re Wilson, 108 F. 197, 1901 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 241 (D. Va. 1901). The purpose of the cash valuation is to enable creditors to ascertain, by inspection of the different articles and the prices affixed thereto, whether the debtor is making a fair and honest claim of homestead, or whether he is giving an underestimate of its value, and thereby securing to himself property that should be subjected to the payment of his debts. In re Waltrip, 260 F. Supp. 448, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6866 (E.D. Va. 1966). The purpose of requiring a reasonably certain description and valuation of property is to enable existing creditors to determine whether the claim is honestly ass erted or whether the debtor is improperly seeking to insulate his property from the payment of his debts. Shirkey v. Leake, 715 F.2d 859, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 24584 (4th Cir. 1983). Requirement that personal property be described with reasonable certainty cannot be defined by a universal standard. Nonetheless, courts cannot be allowed to make wholly subjective determinations of reasonableness. Whether a description is reasonably certain involves a judgment that takes into consideration the purpose of exemption statutes and the characteristics of the object to be described. Certain clearly defined principles exist to assist a court in the exercise of its discretion. Shirkey v. Leake, 715 F.2d 859, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 24584 (4th Cir. 1983). Insufficient description of certain property does not invalidate entire deed.  Although a homestead deed may fail sufficiently to describe and value certain property intended to be set aside as exempt, this will not affect the validity of th e deed as to other property which is accurately described and valued in the mode prescribed by law. Williams v. Watkins, 92 Va. 680, 24 S.E. 223, 1896 Va. LEXIS 30 (1896). Where the deed merely listed and valued various items of property, it did not specify wh ether each debtor was exempting an interest in jointly owned property nor did the deed indicate whether any of the property was individually owned and being exempted by only one of the debtors, the deed thus frustrates the purpose of requiring a reasonab ly certain description of the personal estates. In re Heath, 101 Bankr. 469, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 2385 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1987). Disclosure of date of transaction giving rise to debt not required.  Neither this section, nor any other provision of Virginia law, requires disclosure in the deed of the date of a transaction giving rise to a debt owed to the bank rupt. This requirement to the statute will not be added by judicial gloss when the date serves no critical purpose. Shirkey v. Leake, 715 F.2d 859, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 24584 (4th Cir. 1983). Not applicable to poor debtors exemption.  The procedures of this section and § 34-17 do not apply to the poor debtors exemption of § 34-26. Bryant v. Smith, 165 Bankr. 176, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2942 (W.D. Va. 1994). Wher e incarcerated debtor to file.  Where a debtor was incarcerated in Goochland County, but had resided in Chesterfield County, where her home, personal property, and family were located at the tim e she filed her homestead deed, and intended to return to Chesterfield County upon her release, it was proper to have filed her homestead deed in Chesterfield County. In re Smith, 22 Bankr. 866, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 3422 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982).

LEXIS 6508 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). Generally, statutes creating debtors exemptions must be construed liberally in favor of the debtor and the exemption. Mayer v. Quy Van Nguyen (In re Quy Van N guyen), 211 F.3d 105, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 8271 (4th Cir. 2000). Setting apart includes admitting the homestead deed to record.

Calculatio n of five-day period.  Sections 1-13.3 and 1-13.3:1 [now § 1-210], and not the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, govern how the five-day period provided for in this section shou ld be calculated to determine whether debtors failed to file their homestead deed in a timely fashion. In re Haynesworth, 145 Bankr. 222, 1992 Bankr. LEXIS 1512 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1992). A debtor has five days from the date of the creditors meeting to set apart property claimed to be exempt under the homestead exemption and any interve ning Saturday and Sunday must be counted. Mayer v. Quy Van Nguyen (In re Quy Van Nguyen), 211 F.3d 105, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 8271 (4th Cir. 2000). Reco rdation by clerk at labor date.  When a debtor has filed a homestead deed in proper form with the right clerk, with fees paid, all prior to the deadline established by this section, the debtor ha s set apart his property for purposes of the homestead exemption even though the deed may not be recorded by the clerk until a later date. Mayer v. Quy Van Nguyen (In re Quy Van Nguyen), 211 F.3d 105, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 8271 (4th Cir. 2000). Where debtors bank accounts were not subjected by sale or otherwise before the recordation of the homestead deed, she is entitled to claim the benefit of her exemption. Wilson v. Virginia Nat'l Bank, 214 Va. 14, 196 S.E.2d 920, 1973 Va. LEXIS 245 (1973). Property held subjected.  A creditor obtained judgment and levied execution against his debtor. Suit was brought by other creditors against the execution creditor alleging superior liens, and the execution creditor also brought a chancery suit against the debtor, claiming a lien in his favor on certain property of the debtor. The two suits were heard together. The court decreed that certain funds should be paid to the execution creditor. The same decree directed the payment of all the costs of the suit, and disposed of the entire funds of the debtor in the hands of receivers appointed by the court. After the adjournment of the term of court at which this decree was rendered, the debtor f iled a homestead deed, claiming the amount decreed to be paid to the execution creditor as part of his homestead exemption, and filed a petition in the chancery causes, praying that it be paid over to him as part of his homestead. It was held that the fu nd in question had been subjected within the true intent and meaning of this section before the execution of the homestead deed, and the debtor having failed to claim his homestead privilege before the decree, he was concluded by it, not only bec ause the fund had been subjected thereby, but because it was a final decree settling every controversy which had arisen in the cause. Smith v. Holland, 124 Va. 663, 98 S.E. 676, 1919 Va. LEXIS 155 (1919). General rule is that after the time for filing a homestead deed has expired, the debtor is precluded from amending a homestead deed for purposes other than increasing or decreasing the value of property previously included in the homestead deed, and new property cannot be exempted. Ames v. Custis, 87 Bankr. 415, 1988 Bankr. LEXIS 1080 (B ankr. E.D. Va. 1988). Amendments allowable to include new property.  When a debtor does not own or have an interest in property that is properly exempt at the time the exemption must be asserted, then an amendment may be allowed to include new property so long as the maximum exemptions have not been taken. Ames v. Custis, 87 Bankr. 415, 1988 Bankr. LEXIS 1080 (Bankr. E.D.

For related discussion, see 8A M.J. Exemptions from Execution and Attachment, § 16. CASE NOTES Applicability.  Bankruptcy debtor was not entitled to exempt the full value of real property under § 34-18 since the increase in the value of the debtors equity in propert y since an express exemption in a prior bankruptcy case of the debtor and a now deceased spouse, which resulted from the reduction in the amount of the mortgage lien against it, constituted a permanent improvement placed upon the property funded by the u se of nonexempt funds, which was not entitled to receive the exemption. Moore v. Capital One Bank, 412 Bankr. 830, 2008 Bankr. LEXIS 4184 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2008). By the plain language of § 34-18, the increase in value language modifies only the property that is set apart and, by reference to §§ 34- 4 and 34-6, a debtor sets apart property, which the debtor is entitled to exempt under § 34-4, by recording a homestead deed; thus, the property set apart does not relate to the whole of the property that is exempted and, instead, the property set apa rt only includes that which is exempted under § 34-4 through the procedure established in § 34-6. Moore v. Capital One Bank, 412 Bankr. 830, 2008 Bankr. LEXIS 4184 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2008). Increase in the value of a debtors equity in property resulting from a reduction in the amount of any lien against it is more akin to permanent improvements p laced upon real estate funded by the use of nonexempt funds that are not entitled to receive an exemption under the plain language of § 34-18.

For related discussion, see 8A M.J. Exemptions from Execution and Attachment, § 14. CASE NOTES Perfection of homestead exemption in Chapter 13 proceedings.  Although a Chapter 13 debtor need not perfect his homestead exemption, he derives no benefit from that fact; since Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code involves a re organization rather than a liquidation of the debtors estate, the Chapter 13 debtor retains possession of his assets. Conversely, requiring the Chapter 13 debtor to perfect his homestead exemption would result in an unnecessary exhaustion of the exem ption in a proceeding involving no liquidation of the debtors estate. Grenco Real Estate Inv. Trust v. Morris, 48 Bankr. 313, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21179 (W.D. Va. 1985). Debtor cannot hold property exceeding in aggregate the legal maximum.  While the debtor may supplement the original homestead by a new one, so as to make the aggregate equal to the maximum under this section, this privilege after bei ng once fully exercised is regarded as exhausted. The householder cannot by successive acts hold at one time, or at different times, property which in the aggregate exceeds the maximum value. Oppenheimer v. Howell, 76 Va. 218, 1882 Va. LEXIS 22 (1882). He cannot attack validity of o riginal deed.  If a householder has squandered, or does not account for, the property set apart for his original homestead he cannot found a claim to a new one by attacking the validity of the deed of his own making which created the original. Oppenheimer v. Howell, 76 Va. 218, 1882 Va. LEXIS 22 (1882). Deed could not be amended to decrease value of listed property in order to add new property.  A recorded homestead deed which lists property equal in value to the entire available homestead exemption cannot be amended to decrease the value of listed proper ty in order to add other property not previously listed, at least not if the property was owned by the debtor when the original homestead deed was filed. In re Emerson, 129 Bankr. 82, 1991 Bankr. LEXIS 1523 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1991), aff'd, 962 F.2d 6, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 16912 (4th Cir. 1992).

Supp. 448, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6866 (E.D. Va. 1966). Section not applicable to life insurance exemptions.  In light of the liberality that must be afforded debtors in construing Virginias exemption laws and in light of the clear meaning of this section, it must be concluded that the life insurance exemptions found in former § 38.1-448 (see now § 38.2-3122) and former § 38.1-449 (see now § 38.2-3123) are separate and independent from the homestead exemption found in this title and are not limited by the provisions of this section. In re Redmon, 31 Bankr. 756, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 5960 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1983).

Nuckolls, 780 F.2d 408, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 25728 (4th Cir. 1985). A householder may waive the benefit of his homestead exemption by contractual stipulatio n, and thereby the property set apart as exempt will be subject to the debt. Williams v. Watkins, 92 Va. 680, 24 S.E. 223, 1896 Va. LEXIS 30 (1896). The right to waive the homestead is not unconstitutional or against public policy. Barbar ossa v. Beneficial Fin. Co., 438 F. Supp. 840, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13560 (E.D. Va. 1977). The right to claim the exemption is purely a personal one. The debtor is not compelled t o take advantage of it. There is no power vested in his wife or children or other member of his family, to require him to hold it exempt. White v. Owen, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 43, 1878 Va. LEXIS 48 (1878). The right to claim the homestead exemption is a personal privilege and may be waived. Barbarossa v. Beneficial Fin. Co., 438 F. Supp. 840, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1 3560 (E.D. Va. 1977). Waiver must be express and in writing.  The waiver is required to be in writing and must be expressed in the bond, bill, note or other writing itself, which is the evidence of the obligation, or by a wr iting thereon or annexed thereto, and where it is so done, the exemption is declared to be waived as to the said obligation. Long v. Pence, 93 Va. 584, 25 S.E. 593, 1896 Va. LEXIS 115 (1896). It cannot be made by implication.  Statutes relating to the homestead and constituting a favor of the law to protect the debtor and his family, are liberally construed in favor of the debtor and st rictly against the creditor. Thus the waiver cannot be made by implication, but must be by an express declaration in writing. Home Owners' Loan Corp. v. Reese, 170 Va. 275, 196 S.E. 625, 1938 Va. LEXIS 186 (1938). Waiver does not increase or diminish indebtedness.  The right to claim or to waive a homestead is a question apart from the amount of the indebtedness. The waiver or nonwaiver of the homestead does not increase or diminish the indebtedness. Waiver simply increases the chance of the creditor to collect the debt owing to him, by denying the debtor the right to withdraw a portion of his property from execution or levy. Home Owners' Loan Corp. v. Reese, 170 Va. 275, 1 96 S.E. 625, 1938 Va. LEXIS 186 (1938). There was no conflict between the provisions of this section and § 6.1-289 [see now § 6.2-1528] where the inclusion of a provision in a promissory note waiving appellant-bankrupts homestead exemption did not have the effect of impairing in any manner any rights on the part of anyone as to exemptions under the poor debtors laws since the homestead exemption is a mere personal privilege extended in the benignity of the law to the debtor, which he may waive or claim at his election. Barbarossa v. Beneficial Fin. Co., 438 F. Supp. 840, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13560 (E.D. Va. 1977). Wa iver is conclusive against debtor, his wife and children.  If a party executing his bond or note before or after the property has been set apart as his homestead exemption, waives his homestead exemption as to the bond or note, neither he nor his wife, in his lifetime, nor, after his decease, either his widow or his infant children, can set up said homestead exemption as against said bond or note. Linkenhoker v. Detrick, 81 Va. 44, 1885 Va. LEXIS 8 (1885) (see Reed v. Un ion Bank, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 719 (1878)). Waiver as to obligation of instrument does not apply to liability of assignor.  Waiver of the homestead exemption in the body of a nonnegotiable note is only a waiver as to the particular obligation expressed in the body of the note, and not as to the implied obligation growing out of an assignment of the note, and, as against the liability of the assignor to the assignee, the former may claim the benefit of the exemption, although the note declares that the drawers and endorsers each he reby waive the benefit of our homestead exemptions . . . as to this debt. Long v. Pence, 93 Va. 584, 25 S.E. 593, 1896 Va. LEXIS 115 (1896).

Judgment lien attaches when exemption ceases.  The main object of this section in declaring when the homestead exemption shall cease was to fix the time when the judgment lien shall attach to the exempted real estate. It is declared that the lien shall not attach except to such real estate as the householder shall have at the time the exemption ceases, and that it shall attach at that time. Ackiss v.

Court will not require security for forthcoming of principal on ter mination of exemption.  Although a limit is fixed as to the duration of the homestead no lien attaches thereto until that time has arrived. A court of equity will not require security to be given for the forthcoming of the principal of the exemption at the expiration of the homestead period. Williams v.

Nonresident debtor entitled to exemption under alternate provision of f ederal law.  Where debtor, resident of District of Columbia for two months, filed a petition for voluntary relief in Virginia court as she had resided in Commonwealth for grea ter portion of 180-day residency requirement under 11 U.S.C. § 522(b), but could not receive Virginia exemption as she was not resident in Virginia, she was entitled to exemptions under alternative provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 522(b) due the certainty of congressional intent that every debtor have exemptions to enable him a fresh start and due inapplicability of Virginia state law of exemptions to debtor.

This section and § 34-4 provide debtors with two methods for setting apart property a s exempt from the actions of creditors. Debtors are entitled to the benefits of both exemption methods.

No time or value limits under this section.  There is no limit on the value of the articles exempted under this section, no time specified for setting aside qualifying property, and no procedure specified fo r claiming the property as exempt.

Purpose of amendment of subdivision 7 of this section.  By amending subdivision 7 of this section using the words perfected security interest, the Virginia legislature meant to give both purchase-money and nonp urchase-money security interests priority over the exemption for tools of the trade. Shearer v. Crestar Bank, 132 Bankr. 313, 1991 Bankr. LEXIS 2048 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1991). The procedures of §§ 34-14 and 34-17 do not apply to the poor debtors exemptio n of this section. Bryant v. Smith, 165 Bankr. 176, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2942 (W.D. Va. 1994). Application of monetary limits to value of exemption.  A reading of the complete exemption scheme in this section makes it clear that the monetary limits found in several of its subsections apply to the value of the e xemption rather than the value of the property. In re Fenessy, 156 Bankr. 22, 1993 Bankr. LEXIS 975 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1993). Necessar y wearing apparel.  In a bankruptcy proceeding where the debtor attempted to exempt her $2,500 mink coat, the court held that the phrase all necessary wearing apparel of the debt or and his family warranted granting of the exemption, since the word necessary is not a word of limitation requiring the fixing of a value upon clothing as a criteria in determining its exempt status. In re Perry, 6 Bankr. 263, 1980 Bankr. L EXIS 4409 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). A person must be a resident of Virginia in order to qualify for the poor debtors exe mption under this section. Davis v.

Section does not protect one in unlawful possession of property.  This section does not contemplate that an intruder, who does not own the property levied on and is in unlawful possession of it, may have the property set aside f or the use of himself and his family. Boswell v. Lipscomb, 177 Va. 309, 14 S.E.2d 305, 1941 Va. LEXIS 218 (1941). Conflict between language of subdivision 7 of this section and § 34-28.  Section 34-28, which was not amended in 1990, expressly voids all nonpurchase-money security interests on property exempted under this section, but leaves purchas e money security interests in place. Prior to 1990, the effect of § 34-28 was the same on all property which could be exempted under this section. Because § 34-28 was not amended in 1990 when this section was, a conflict exists between the language in subdivision 7 of this section which gives perfected security interests priority over the exemption for tools of the trade and the language in § 34-28 which voids nonpurchase-money security interests in exempted property. Shearer v. Crestar Bank, 1 32 Bankr. 313, 1991 Bankr. LEXIS 2048 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1991). To the extent that amended subdivision 7 of this section conflicts with § 34-28, the language in subdivision of this section, which is the more specific and m ore recently enacted statute, will be given effect.

CASE NOTES Se ction 34-28 applies to property exempt under this section.  Under § 34-28 a deed of trust executed by a householder engaged in agriculture conveying articles embraced in this section is void; for, although this section is not specifically mentioned in § 34-28, it is by inference so allied to § 34-26 as to prompt the strongest implication that by legislative intention it is embraced within the meaning of § 34-28. The opposing view is narrow and constricted, and if adopted would defeat the purpose of § 34-28, and § 34-28 is a remedial one and must be liberally construed. South Hill Prod. Credit Ass'n v. Hudson, 174 Va. 284, 6 S.E.2d 668, 1940 Va. LEXIS 211 (1940). Section does not apply to one in unlawful possession of property.  This section does not contemplate that an intruder, who does not own the property levied on and is in unlawful possession of it, may have the property set aside f or the use of himself and his family. Boswell v. Lipscomb, 177 Va. 309, 14 S.E.2d 305, 1941 Va. LEXIS 218 (1941). Deed of trust is void.  A deed of trust executed by a householder engaged in agriculture, conveying articles embraced in this section is void. South Hill Prod. Credit Ass'n v. Hudson, 17 4 Va. 284, 6 S.E.2d 668, 1940 Va. LEXIS 211 (1940). The legislature did not intend that a party could engage in several trades or occupations in order to claim multiple exemptions. To do so would be to allow a debtor to engage potentially in a vocation as a mechanic, an oysterman or fisherman, and a farmer, and thereby claim additional exemptions. In re Samuel, 36 Bankr. 312, 1984 Bank r. LEXIS 6486 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1984). Liberal construction.  This section is a remedial statute which should be liberally construed. Meadows v. F &amp; M Nat'l Bank, 75 Bankr. 357, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6093 (W.D. Va. 1987). In determining whether the exemption under this section is available, the court must loo k to the time that the bankruptcy petition was filed. Meadows v. F &amp; M Nat'l Bank, 75 Bankr. 357, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6093 (W.D. Va. 1987). It is clear that agriculture is not confined solely to the raising of crops. The fact that debtor derived the greater part of his farm income from the sale and transportation of livestock does not take him outside the exemption sections definition of one engaged in the business of agriculture. Fleet Bros. v. Newsome, 60 Bankr. 169, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 6353 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1986). The court finds that the Hazelwood stock trailer is exempt as a wagon or cart wi thin the contemplation of the statute. Debtor has in reality no other way to get his animals to market. The exemption statute provides for the exemption of a wagon or cart, and it appears that this section intends that a farmer be allowed to exem pt a piece of equipment which he needs to transport his commodities. The court acknowledges that this is a liberal interpretation of the statutes terms; however, as mentioned earlier, such is the analysis the Virginia courts have adopted. Fleet Bros. v. Newsome, 60 Bankr. 169, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 6353 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1986). Disc found exempt.  Given that the statute allows an exemption for two plows, it may reasonably be concluded that a farmer may need more than one type of plow to till the soil in var ying conditions. The fact that a disc does not turn over the soil as a plow might is not dispositive of whether or not debtor may claim it as exempt. The court finds that the legislature intended an exemption for a farm implement that a farmer can use to get his land ready for planting, and at the present debtor would be unable to till his land in a manner satisfactory to him without the use of the disc as a plow. For that reason, the court finds that debtor may properly claim the disc as exempt under t his section. Fleet Bros. v. Newsome, 60 Bankr. 169, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 6353 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1986). Debtor qualifying for fa rming exemption.  Even though the debtor was not physically present and performing manual labor on the land itself, debtor owned outright 102 acres of currently farmed land; she an d her husband farmed the land for 35 years until his death in 1987; she owned 14 percent of a corporation actively farming 700 acres of land; the machinery and equipment were currently used in the farming operations; and she participated in the decision- making process of the farm operations, therefore, the debtor was actively and legitimately engaged in the business of farming for the purposes of Bankruptcy Code § 522(f)(2)(B) and this section and was engaged in the trade of farming pursuant to subdi vision 7 of § 34-26.

Shearer v. Crestar Bank, 132 Bankr. 313, 1991 Bankr. LEXIS 2048 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1991). Debtor can exempt up to $2,000 in value of a vehicle.  Virginia state laws allow a debtor to exempt, and avoid the lien on, up to $2,000 in value of a motor vehicle where that lien is neither a perfected security inte rest, nor was it given to secure a loan for the purchase of the vehicle. In re Fenessy, 156 Bankr. 22, 1993 Bankr. LEXIS 975 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1993). Exemption could apply to proceeds from sale of vehicle.  Where debtors claim of exemption was properly noticed long before sale of vehicle, the debtors exemption could apply to proceeds from sale of the vehicle, even if the vehicle itself was subject to an exemption. In re Fenessy, 156 Bankr. 22, 1993 Bankr. LEXIS 975 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1993). Bankruptcy court determines whether personal injury claims are exempt.  Fact that a debtors personal injury claims might be exempt property under § 34-28.1 did not determine whether the claims were property of the bankruptcy es tate because the commencement of the debtors Chapter 7 created an estate comprised of the property and interests described in 11 U.S.C.S. § 541 and it was only through the administration of the estate that the propriety of such exemptions was dete rmined in a manner consistent with 11 U.S.C.S. § 522.

Exemptions from Executi on and Attachment, § 21. CASE NOTES Wrongful death claims distinct from personal injury category.  This section refers to causes of action for personal injury or wrongful death, inviting the inference that Virginia intended this section to exempt two di stinct types of actions from creditor process, neither of which would define or limit the other. That this section was only recently amended to include wrongful death claims bolsters the conclusion that such claims are viewed as distinct from the categor y of personal injury. In re Webb, 214 Bankr. 553, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17836 (E.D. Va. 1997). Personal injury proceeds only exempt from creditor with unsecured claim.  This section only applies to the efforts of creditors at exercising process against unsecured debts; it does not apply where a party who has paid medical expenses has an equitable subrogation lien against the proceeds of the injured partys personal injury recovery and such proceeds are not exempt from a claim by such a lienholder. In re Carpenter, 245 Bankr. 39, 2000 Bankr. LEXIS 209 (Bankr. E.D. Va.), aff'd, 252 Bankr. 905, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13797 (E.D. Va. 2000). Personal injury lawsuit settlement.  Account exempted under this section as the proceeds of a personal injury lawsuit settlement did not lose its exemption where tax refund monies were commingled int o the account post-petition and later removed as this section did not require that the proceeds of a personal injury claim be deposited into a specially designated account, and the funds were easily traceable; there was no reason to depart from the gener al rule that exemptions were to be determined as of the date of the bankruptcy petition, and in this case, there was no requirement that the debtor had to segregate the proceeds of a personal injury settlement post-petition to maintain an exemption prope rly claimed under this section. In re Lane, No. 17-70336, 2017 Bankr. LEXIS 1992 (Bankr. W.D. Va. July 19, 2017). No exemption for u nlisted personal injury action.  Chapter 7 debtor was not allowed an exemption under § 34-28.1 for an unscheduled personal injury action because he did not provide an excusable reason why the cause of action was not listed while his bankruptcy case was open. Under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1009 and 9006, the debtor did not have the right as a matter of course to amend his schedules after the case was closed, and he was responsible for full disclosure on the schedules under 11 U.S.C.S. § 521. In re Wilmoth, 412 Bankr. 791, 2009 Bankr. LEXIS 882 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2009). Medical malpractice claim.  Because the former debtors malpractice claim ceased to property of the estate under 11 U.S.C.S. § 541 when no objection to the debtors claim of an exem ption to the malpractice action under § 34-28.1 was timely filed under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(b), there was no reason to reopen the bankruptcy case to determine if a state court later improperly disbursed the settlement funds. In re Zaidi, 293 Bankr. 861, 2002 Bankr. LEXIS 1721 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2002). Legal malpractice claim.  Debtors legal malpractice claims were not exempt under this provision because the legal malpractice claims at issue were not proceeds derived from a court awa rd or settlement. In re Sheikhzadeh, No. 14-14219-BFK, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 1924 (Bankr. E.D. Va. June 26, 2018).

CASE NOTES Applicability.  Law governing garnishments did not apply because the monthly payment amount set by the trial court was not a garnishment but was a payment plan to allow a wife to purge herself of contempt. Wharam v. Austin, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 307 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 5, 2017). Limitation.  Wage garnishments, except for enforcement of support or tax obligations, are limited to 25% of disposable income. In re Wilkinson, 196 Bankr. 311, 1996 Bankr. LEX IS 595 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1996). Because this section only applies to exempt earnings that are subject to garnishment, and the debtors earnings or wages in this case had not been subject to a judicial or equitable proceeding of garnishment, Chapter 7 trustees objection to debtors claim of exemption under this section was well taken. In re Kluge, No. 11-61517-LYN, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 5780 (Bankr. W.D. Va. Oct. 3, 2011). Bankruptcy debtor improperly claimed an exemption in a portion of accounts receivable owed to the debtor for services rendered prior to the debtors bankruptcy since there was no pending garnishment of the debtors earnings and thus the protection of a percentage of the debtors earnings did not apply. In re Pierce, No. 15-71047, 2015 Bankr. LEXIS 4372 (Bankr. W.D. Va. Dec. 30, 2015). Trustees objection to Chapter 13 debtors Amended Schedule C insofar as debtor claimed exemption in his post-petition wages was sustained because any claim of exemption for post-petition wages; whether under Virginias wage exemption statute or Virginias wildcard exemption statute, was fundamentally inconsistent with requirement that debtor devote all of his disposable income to his Chapter 13 plan. In re Cantu, 553 Bankr. 565, 2016 Bankr. LEXIS 2585 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2016), aff'd, 713 Fed. Appx. 200, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 25487 (4th Cir. 2017).

For the pur poses of this section:Alternate payee shall have the same meaning as provided under § 206 of t he Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). In the case of a retirement plan that is not subject to ERISA, the term alternate payee means an individual who has an interest in a retirement plan pursuant to a judgment, decree, or or der, including approval of a property settlement agreement, that would be described in § 206(d)(3)(B) of ERISA if the retirement plan were subject to ERISA.Annual benefit  means an amount payable as an annuity for the lifetime of the individual who claims the exemption provided under this section, assuming that annuity payments will commence up on the individuals attainment of age sixty-five or, if the individual attained age sixty-five on or before the exemption provided under this section is claimed, the individuals age on the date that the exemption is claimed. Retirement plan means a plan, account, or arrangement that is intended to satisfy the requirements of United States Int ernal Revenue Code §§ 401, 403 (a), 403 (b), 408, 408A, 409 (as in effect prior to repeal by United States P.L. 98-369), or § 457. Whether a plan, account, or arrangement is intended to satisfy the requirements of one of the foregoing provisions shall be determined based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, the issuance of a favorable determination letter by the United States Internal Revenue Service, reports or returns filed with United States or state agencies, and communications from the plan sponsor to participants. B. Except as o therwise provided in this section, the interest of an individual under a retirement plan shall be exempt from creditor process to the same extent permitted under federal bankruptcy law for such a plan. The exemption provided by this section shall be avai lable whether such individual has an interest in the retirement plan as a participant, beneficiary, contingent annuitant, alternate payee, or otherwise. C. The exempti on provided under subsection B shall not apply to claims made against an individual by the alternate payee of such individual or to claims made against such individual by the Commonwealth in administrative actions pursuant to Chapter 19 (§ 63.2-1900 e t seq.) of Title 63.2 or any court process to enforce a child or child and spousal support obligation. D. If two indi viduals who are married or were married are entitled to claim the exemption provided under subsection B of an interest under the same retirement plan or plans and such individuals are jointly subject to creditor process as to the same debt or obligation and the debt or obligation arose during the marriage, then the exemption provided under subsection B as to such debts or obligations shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the exemption permitted under federal bankruptcy law for such a plan. The exemption p ermitted under federal bankruptcy law shall be allocated among such persons in the same proportion as their respective interests in the retirement plan or plans. E. The exempti on provided under this section must be claimed within the time limits prescribed by § 34-17.

The cases cited below were decided prior to 2007 amendments to this section, which rewrote the section. This section provides a limited exemption for retirement plans to the extent necessary t o produce an annual retirement benefit of $17,500 [now $25,000]. In re Bissell, 255 Bankr. 402, 2000 Bankr. LEXIS 1407 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2000). Section not preempted by ERISA.  Since deeming I.R.C. § 401(k) plans to be retirement plans under subsection A of § 34-34 would not impair any federal law, and would in fact implement the e xpress federal authority permitting the state to set appropriate exemption levels on retirement benefits for bankruptcy purposes, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) does not preempt subsection A of § 34-34 nor preclude consideration o f a debtors I.R.C. § 401(k) plan in determining the allowable IRA exemption. Abbate v. Spear, 289 Bankr. 62, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2455 (E.D. Va. 2003). Essentially, an individual may hold exempt in a retirement plan an amount that would pay a benefit of $17,500 [now $25,000] per year for life beginning at age 65. In re Cathcart, 203 Bankr. 599, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 1526 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1996). The thrust of this statute is to give a debtor who has no other tax-qualified retirement plan the right to an unlimited exemption for an individual retirement account but to deny the unlimited exemption to a person who is covered by such a plan. In re Hasse, 246 Bankr. 247, 2000 Bankr. LEXIS 300 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2000). There is no apparent bar to claiming a homestead exemption in addition to whatever amoun ts may be held exempt under this section. In re Cathcart, 203 Bankr. 599, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 1526 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1996). Exemption unlimite d as to all plans not specified.  This section specifically identifies the types of retirement plans for which a debtors exemption is limited; a debtor who participates in a plan other than of the type specified is entitled to an unlimited exemption even though such plan is functionally indistinguishable from those specified in the statute. In re Hasse, 246 Bankr. 247, 2000 Bankr. LEXIS 300 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2000). Schedule ambiguity const rued against debtor.  Although Virginias exemption statutes are construed liberally, any ambiguities found in the debtors schedules are construed against the debtor. Thus, sinc e filing his schedules, debtor has made no attempt to amend his exemption upward to take advantage of the maximum claim available under this section, consequently, the only portion of his interest that is exempt is $1.00. Thompson v. Board of Trustees, 1 82 Bankr. 140, 1995 Bankr. LEXIS 703 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995), aff'd, 92 F.3d 1182, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 28049 (4th Cir. 1996). Debtors prohibited transactions with account resulted in loss of exemption. Debtor s actions with respect to his SEP-IRA account were deemed to be prohibited transactions with a disqualified person, under 26 U.S.C.S. § 4975, that caused the account to lose its status as an individual retirement account under 26 U.S.C.S. § 408 (k), and thereby also lose its exemption under § 34-34. In re Meredith, No. 03-34018-DOT, 2005 Bankr. LEXIS 2798 (Bankr. E.D. Va. May 19, 2005). Debtors wifes interest in debtor husbands IRA as death beneficiary was at best an expectancy and thus had no real value; therefore, she could not exempt this interest under the homestead exemption in addition to couples retirement exemption.
