Lapine. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3A M.J. Banks and Banking, § 2. CASE NOTES Co ntract principles displaced by Uniform Commercial Code.  Title 8.4, which governs the relationships between a bank and its customers, delineates the rights of a customer against its drawee bank for the improper payment of checks drawn on the customers account; the principles of contract law have been displaced by the Uniform Commercial Code, which was enacted to promote uniformity, predictability and finality in certain types of commercial transactions. Halifax Cor p. v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 262 Va. 91, 546 S.E.2d 696, 2001 Va. LEXIS 74 (2001). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. The great number of checks handled by banks and the country-wide nature of the bank collection process require uniformity in the law of bank collections. Ther e is needed a uniform statement of the principal rules of the bank collection process with ample provision for flexibility to meet the needs of the large volume handled and the changing needs and conditions that are bound to come with the years. This Art icle meets that need. 2. In 1950 at the time Article 4 was drafted, 6.7 billion checks were written annually. By the time of the 1990 revision of Article 4 annual volume was estimated by the American Bankers Association to be about 50 billion checks. The banking system could not have coped with this increase in check volume had it not developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s an automated system for check collection based on encodi ng checks with machine-readable information by Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR). An important goal of the 1990 revision of Article 4 is to promote the efficiency of the check collection process by making the provisions of Article 4 more compati ble with the needs of an automated system and, by doing so, increase the speed and lower the cost of check collection for those who write and receive checks. An additional goal of the 1990 revision of Article 4 is to remove any statutory barriers in the Article to the ultimate adoption of programs allowing the presentment of checks to payor banks by electronic transmission of information captured from the MICR line on the checks. The potential of these programs for saving the time and expense of trans porting the huge volume of checks from depositary to payor banks is evident. 3. Article 4 defines rights between parties with respect to bank deposits and collections. It is not a regulatory statute. It does not regulate the terms of the bank-customer agreement, nor does it prescribe what constraints different jurisdictions may wish to impose on that relationship in the interest of consumer protection. The revisions in Article 4 are intended to create a legal framework that accommodate s automation and truncation for the benefit of all bank customers. This may raise consumer problems which enacting jurisdictions may wish to address in individual legislation. For example, with respect to Section 4-401(c), jurisdictions may wish to exam ine their unfair and deceptive practices laws to determine whether they are adequate to protect drawers who postdate checks from unscrupulous practices that may arise on the part of persons who induce drawers to issue postdated checks in the erroneous be lief that the checks will not be immediately payable. Another example arises from the fact that under various truncation plans customers will no longer receive their cancelled checks and will no longer have the cancelled check to prove payment. Individ ual legislation might provide that a copy of a bank statement along with a copy of the check is prima facie evidence of payment. VIRGINIA COMMENT Title 8.4 is discussed in Harrell, Virginia and Article 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code, 18 Wash. and Lee L. Rev. 350 (1961). This title replaces the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, enacted in Virginia in 1897, to the extent that it applied to this subject. See Virginia Comment to Ti tle 8.3. Virginia never adopted the Bank Collection Code of the American Bankers Association, the basis for many of the rules contained in this title.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-102"><akn:num>§ 8.4-102</akn:num><akn:heading>Applicability</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) To the ext ent that items within this title are also within the scope of Titles 8.3A and 8.8A, they are subject to those titles.

(b) The liabil ity of a bank for action or nonaction with respect to an item handled by it for purposes of presentment, payment or collection is governed by the law of the place where the bank is located. In the case of action or nonaction by or at a branch or separat e office of a bank, its liability is governed by the law of the place where the branch or separate office is located. History History. 1964, c. 219; 1992, c. 693. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3A M.J. Banks and Banking, § 54. OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. The rules of Article 3 governing negotiable instruments, their transfer, and the contracts of the parties thereto apply to the items collected through banking channels wherever no specific provision is found in this Article. In the case of conflict, this Article governs. See Section 3-102(b). Bonds and like instruments constituting investment securities under Article 8 may also be handled by banks for collection purposes. Various sections of Article 8 prescribe rules of transfer some of which (see Sections 8-304 and 8-306) may conflict with provisions of this Article (Sections 4-205, 4-207, and 4-208). In the case of conflict, Article 8 governs. Section 4-210 deals specifically with overlapping problems and possible conflicts between this Article and Article 9. However, similar reconciling provisions are not necessary in the case of Articles 5 and 7. Sections 4-301 and 4-302 are consistent with Section 5-112. In the case of Article 7 documents of title frequently accompany items but they are not themselves items. See Section 4-104(a)(9). In Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U.S. 363 (1943), the Court held that if the United States is a party to an instrument, its rights and duties are gov erned by federal common law in the absence of a specific federal statute or regulation. In United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U.S. 715 (1979), the Court stated a three-pronged test to ascertain whether the federal common-law rule should follow th e state rule. In most instances courts under the Kimbell test have shown a willingness to adopt UCC rules in formulating federal common law on the subject. In Kimbell the Court adopted the priorities rules of Article 9. In addition, applicable federal law may supersede provisions of this Article. One federal law that does so is the Expedited Funds Availability Act, 12 U.S.C. § 4001 et seq., and its implementing Regulation CC, 12 CFR Pt. 229. In some instances this law is alluded to in the statute, e.g., Section 4-215(e) and (f). In other instances, although not referred to in this Article, the provisions of the EFAA and Regulation CC control with respect to checks. For example, except between the depositary bank and its customer, all settlements are final and not provisional (Regulation CC, Section 229.36(d)), and the midnight deadline may be extended (Regulation CC, Section 229.30(c)). The Comments to this Article suggest in most instances the relevant Regulation CC provisions. 2. Subsection (b) is designed to state a workable rule for the solution of otherwise vexatious problems of the conflicts of laws: a. The routine and mechanical nature of bank collections makes it imperative that one law govern the activities of one office of a bank. The requirement found in some cases that to hold an indorser notice must be given in accordance with the law of the place of indorsement, since that method of notice became an implied term of the indorsers contract, is more theoretical than practical. b. Adoption of what is in essence a tort theory of the conflict of laws is consistent with the general theory of this Article that the basic duty of a collecting bank is one of good faith and the exercise of ordinary care. Justification lies in the fact that, in using an ambulatory instrument, the drawer, payee, and indorsers must know that action will be taken with respect to it in other jurisdictions. This is especially pertinent with respect to the law of the place of payment. c. The phrase action or non-action with respect to any item handled by it for purposes of presentment, payment, or collection is intended to make the conf licts rule of subsection (b) apply from the inception of the collection process of an item through all phases of deposit, forwarding, presentment, payment and remittance or credit of proceeds. Specifically the subsection applies to the initial act of a d epositary bank in receiving an item and to the incidents of such receipt. The conflicts rule of Weissman v. Banque de Bruxelles, 254 N.Y. 488, 173 N.E. 835 (1930), is rejected. The subsection applies to questions of possible vicarious liability of a ban k for action or non-action of sub-agents (see Section 4-202(c)), and tests these questions by the law of the state of the location of the bank which uses the sub-agent. The conflicts rule of St. Nicholas Bank of New York v. State Nat. Bank, 128 N.Y. 26, 27 N.E. 849, 13 L.R.A. 241 (1891), is rejected. The subsection applies to action or non-action of a payor bank in connection with handling an item (see Sections 4-215(a), 4-301, 4-302, 4-303) as well as action or non-action of a collecting bank (Sectio ns 4-201 through 4-216); to action or non-action of a bank which suspends payment or is affected by another bank suspending payment (Section 4-216); to action or non-action of a bank with respect to an item under the rule of Part 4 of Article 4. d. In a case in which subsection (b) makes this Article applicable, Section 4-103(a) leaves open the possibility of an agreement with respect to applicable law. This freedom of agreement follows the general policy of Section 1-105. VIRGINIA COMMENT This section is consistent with Fourth National Bank v. Bragg, 127 Va. 47, 60-64, 102, 102 S.E. 649, (1920), which applied the law of the place where a bank took an instrument from its customer to determine whether the bank was a purchaser or agent. Under this section the question would be determined by the law of the place where the bank is located.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-103"><akn:num>§ 8.4-103</akn:num><akn:heading>Variation by agreement; measure of damages; action constituting ordinary care</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) The effect of the provisions of this title may be varied by agreement but the parties to the agreement cannot disclaim a banks responsibility for its lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care or limit the measure of damages for the lack or failur e.

CASE NOTES Variation of period for reporting unauthorized signatures.  Under subsection (a) of this section, a bank and its customer could validly agree to reduce the time period within which the customer was obligated to report any unauthorized signatures or alterations on withdrawals from its account from one year to 60 days. Nat'l Title Ins. Corp. Agency v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 263 Va. 355, 559 S.E.2d 668, 2002 Va. LEXIS 30 (2002). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Section 1-102 states the general principles and rules for variation of the effect of this Act by agreement and the limitations to this power. Section 4-103 st ates the specific rules for variation of Article 4 by agreement and also certain standards of ordinary care. In view of the technical complexity of the field of bank collections, the enormous number of items handled by banks, the certainty that there wi ll be variations from the normal in each days work in each bank, the certainty of changing conditions and the possibility of developing improved methods of collection to speed the process, it would be unwise to freeze present methods of operation by mandatory statutory rules. This section, therefore, permits within wide limits variation of the effect of provisions of the Article by agreement. 2. Subsection (a) confers blanket power to vary all provisions of the Article by agreements of the ordinary kind. The agreements may not disclaim a banks res ponsibility for its own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care and may not limit the measure of damages for the lack or failure, but this subsection like Section 1-102(3) approves the practice of parties determining by agreement the stan dards by which the responsibility is to be measured. In the absence of a showing that the standards manifestly are unreasonable, the agreement controls. Owners of items and other interested parties are not affected by agreements under this subsection u nless they are parties to the agreement or are bound by adoption, ratification, estoppel or the like. As here used agreement has the meaning given to it by Section 1-201(3). The agreement may be direct, as between the owner and the depositary bank; or ind irect, as in the case in which the owner authorizes a particular type of procedure and any bank in the collection chain acts pursuant to such authorization. It may be with respect to a single item; or to all items handled for a particular customer, e.g. , a general agreement between the depositary bank and the customer at the time a deposit account is opened. Legends on deposit tickets, collection letters and acknowledgments of items, coupled with action by the affected party constituting acceptance, a doption, ratification, estoppel or the like, are agreements if they meet the tests of the definition of agreement. See Section 1-201(3). First Nat. Bank of Denver v. Federal Reserve Bank, 6 F.2d 339 (8th Cir. 1925) (deposit slip); Jefferson Coun ty Bldg. Assn v. Southern Bank &amp; Trust Co., 225 Ala. 25, 142 So. 66 (1932) (signature card and deposit slip); Semingson v. Stock Yards Nat. Bank, 162 Minn. 424, 203 N.W. 412 (1925) (passbook); Farmers State Bank v. Union Nat. Bank, 42 N.D. 449, 454, 173 N.W. 789, 790 (1919) (acknowledgment of receipt of item). 3. Subsection (a) (subject to its limitations with respect to good faith and ordinary care) goes far to meet the requirements of flexibility. However, it does no t by itself confer fully effective flexibility. Since it is recognized that banks handle a great number of items every business day and that the parties interested in each item include the owner of the item, the drawer (if it is a check), all nonbank in dorsers, the payor bank and from one to five or more collecting banks, it is obvious that it is impossible, practically, to obtain direct agreements from all of these parties on all items. In total, the interested parties constitute virtually every adul t person and business organization in the United States. On the other hand they may become bound to agreements on the principle that collecting banks acting as agents have authority to make binding agreements with respect to items being handled. This c onclusion was assumed but was not flatly decided in Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond v. Malloy, 264 U.S. 160, at 167, 44 S. Ct. 296, at 298, 68 L. Ed. 617, 31 A.L.R. 1261 (1924). To meet this problem subsection (b) provides that official or quasi-official rules of collection, that is Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars, cle aring-house rules, and the like, have the effect of agreements under subsection (a), whether or not specifically assented to by all parties interested in items handled. Consequently, such official or quasi-official rules may, standing by themselves but subject to the good faith and ordinary care limitations, vary the effect of the provisions of Article 4. Federal Reserve regulations. Various sections of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 221 et seq.) authorize the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys tem to direct the Federal Reserve banks to exercise bank collection functions. For example, Section 16 (12 U.S.C. § 248(o)) authorizes the Board to require each Federal Reserve bank to exercise the functions of a clearing house for its members and Se ction 13 (12 U.S.C. § 342) authorizes each Federal Reserve bank to receive deposits from nonmember banks solely for the purposes of exchange or of collection. Under this statutory authorization the Board has issued Regulation J (Subpart A  Collec tion of Checks and Other Items). Under the supremacy clause of the Constitution, federal regulations prevail over state statutes. Moreover, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 4007(b) provides that the Act and Regulation CC, 12 CFR 2 29, supersede any provision of the law of any State, including the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in such State, which is inconsistent with this chapter or such regulations. See Comment 1 to Section 4-102. Federal Reserve operating circulars. The regulations of the Federal Reserve Board authorize the Federal Reserve banks to promulgate operating circulars covering operating details. Regulation J, for example, provides that Each Reserve Bank shall receive and handle items in accordance with this subpart, and shall issue operating circulars governing the details of its handling of items and other matters deemed appropriate by the Reserve Bank. This Article recognizes that operating circulars issued pursuant to the regulations and concerned with operating details as appropriate may, within their proper sphere, vary the effect of the Article. Clearing-House Rules. Local clearing houses have long issued rules governing the details of clearing; hours of clearing, media of remittance, time for return of mis-sent items and the like. The case law has recognized these rules, within their proper sphere, as binding on affected parties and as appropriate sources for the courts to look to in filling out details of bank collection law. Subsection (b) in recog nizing clearing-house rules as a means of preserving flexibility continues the sensible approach indicated in the cases. Included in the term clearing houses are county and regional clearing houses as well as those within a single city or town. There is, of course, no intention of authorizing a local clearing house or a group of clearing houses to rewrite the basic law generally. The term clearing-house rules should be understood in the light of functions the clearing houses have exerc ised in the past. And the like. This phrase is to be construed in the light of the foregoing. Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars cover rules and regulati ons issued by public or quasi-public agencies under statutory authority. Clearing-house rules cover rules issued by a group of banks which have associated themselves to perform through a clearing house some of their collection, payment and cleari ng functions. Other agencies or associations of this kind may be established in the future whose rules and regulations could be appropriately looked on as constituting means of avoiding absolute statutory rigidity. The phrase and the like leave s open possibilities for future development.

CASE NOTES Investors fa iled to prove that they were customers.  Investors failed to prove that they were customers of a bank under circumstances in which third parties deposited the investors funds in accounts at t he bank as part of the third parties scheme to defraud the investors. Collins v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 272 Va. 744, 636 S.E.2d 442, 2006 Va. LEXIS 95 (2006). Deposit by one person to credit of another.  A depositor is ordinarily a person who delivers to or leaves with a bank money subject to his order, either upon time deposit or subject to check. But whe n one person makes a deposit of money in a bank to the credit of another, with the latters consent, the latter person becomes the depositor and a debtor-creditor relationship is created between the bank and the depositor. Such deposit or becomes a customer within the meaning of subsection (1) (e), and the bank is liable for any payment from that account not authorized by the customer. United Va. Bank v. E.L.B. Tank Constr., Inc., 226 Va. 551, 311 S.E.2d 773, 1984 Va. LEXIS 294 (1984). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Paragraph (a)(1): Account is defined to include both asset accounts in which a customer has deposited money and accounts from which a customer may dra w on a line of credit. The limiting factor is that the account must be in a bank. 2. Paragraph (a)(3): Banking day. Under this definition that part of a business day when a bank is open only for limited functions, e.g., to receive dep osits and cash checks, but with loan, bookkeeping and other departments closed, is not part of a banking day. 3. Paragraph (a)(4): Clearing house. Occasionally express companies, governmental agencies and other nonbanks deal directly with a clearing house; hence the definition does not limit the term to an association of banks. 4. Paragraph (a)(5): Customer. It is to be noted that this term includes a bank carrying an account with another bank as well as the more typical nonban k customer or depositor. 5. Paragraph (a)(6): Documentary draft applies even though the documents do not accompany the draft but are to be received by the drawee or other payor b efore acceptance or payment of the draft. 6. Paragraph (a)(7): Draft is defined in Section 3-104 as a form of instrument. Since Article 4 applies to items that may not fall within the definition of instrument, the term is defined here to include an item that is a written order to pay money, even though the item may not qualify as an instrument. The term order is defined in Section 3-103. 7. Paragraph (a)(8): Drawee is defined in Section 3-103 in terms of an Article 3 draft which is a form of instrument. Here drawee is defined in t erms of an Article 4 draft which includes items that may not be instruments. 8. Paragraph (a)(9): Item is defined broadly to include an instrument, as defined in Section 3-104, as well as promises or orders that may not be within the definition of instrument. The terms promise and order are defined in Section 3-103. A promise is a written undertaking to pay money. An order is a written instruction to pay money. But see Section 4-110(c). Since bonds an d other investment securities under Article 8 may be within the term instrument or promise, they are items and when handled by banks for collection are subject to this Article. See Comment 1 to Section 4-102. The functional limitation o n the meaning of this term is the willingness of the banking system to handle the instrument, undertaking or instruction for collection or payment. 9. Paragraph (a)(10): Midnight deadline. The use of this phrase is an example of the more mechanical approach used in this Article. Midnight is selecte d as a termination point or time limit to obtain greater uniformity and definiteness than would be possible from other possible terminating points, such as the close of the banking day or business day. 10. Paragraph (a)(11): The term settle has substantial importance throughout Article 4. In the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code, in def erred posting statutes, in Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars, in clearing-house rules, in agreements between banks and customers and in legends on deposit tickets and collection letters, there is repeated reference to conditional  or provisional credits or payments. Tied in with this concept of credits or payments being in some way tentative, has been a related but somewhat different problem as to when an item is paid or finally paid either to determi ne the relative priority of the item as against attachments, stop-payment orders and the like or in insolvency situations. There has been extensive litigation in the various states on these problems. To a substantial extent the confusion, the litigatio n and even the resulting court decisions fail to take into account that in the collection process some debits or credits are provisional or tentative and others are final and that very many debits or credits are provisional or tentative for awhile but la ter become final. Similarly, some cases fail to recognize that within a single bank, particularly a payor bank, each item goes through a series of processes and that in a payor bank most of these processes are preliminary to the basic act of payment or final payment. The term settle is used as a convenient term to characterize a broad variety of conditional, provisional, tentative and also final payments of items. Suc h a comprehensive term is needed because it is frequently difficult or unnecessary to determine whether a particular action is tentative or final or when a particular credit shifts from the tentative class to the final class. Therefore, its use throughou t the Article indicates that in that particular context it is unnecessary or unwise to determine whether the debit or the credit or the payment is tentative or final. However, if qualified by the adjective provisional its tentative nature is int ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-105"><akn:num>§ 8.4-105</akn:num><akn:heading>Bank; depositary bank; intermediary bank; collecting bank; payor bank; presenting bank</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p> Text In this title: (1) Bank means a person engaged in the business of banking, including a savings institution, credit uni on or trust company; (2) Depositary bank means the first bank to take an item even though it is also the payor bank, unless the item is presented for immediate payment over the counter; (3) Payor bank means a bank that is the drawee of a draft; (4) Intermediary bank means a bank to which an item is transferred in the course of collection except t he depositary or payor bank; (5) Collecting bank means a bank handling an item for collection except the payor bank; (6) Presenting bank means a bank presenting an item except a payor bank.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3A M.J. Banks and Banking, § 49. OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. The definitions in general exclude a bank to which an item is issued, as this bank does not take by transfer except in the particular case covered in which the item is issued to a payee for collection, as in the case in which a corporation is transferring balances from one account to another. Thus, the definition of depositary bank does not include the bank to which a check is made payable if a check is given in payment of a mortgage. This bank has the status of a payee under Article 3 on Negotiable Instruments and not that of a collecting bank. 2. Paragraph (1): Bank is defined in Section 1-201(4) as meaning any person engaged in the business of banking. The definition in paragraph (1) m akes clear that bank includes savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and trust companies, in addition to the commercial banks commonly denoted by use of the term bank. 3. Paragraph (2): A bank that takes an on us item for collection, for application to a customers loan, or first handles the item for other reasons is a depositary bank even though it is also the payor bank. However, if the holder presents the item for immediate payment over the counter, the payor bank is not a depositary bank. 4. Paragraph (3): The definition of payor bank is clarified by use of the term drawee. That term is defined in Section 4-104 as meaning a pe rson ordered in a draft to make payment. An order is defined in Section 3-103 as meaning a written instruction to pay money . . . . An authorization to pay is not an order unless the person authorized to pay is also instructed to pay.  The definition of order is incorporated into Article 4 by Section 4-104(c). Thus a payor bank is one instructed to pay in the item. A bank does not become a payor bank by being merely authorized to pay or by being given an instruction to pay not c ontained in the item. 5. Paragraph (4): The term intermediary bank includes the last bank in the collection process if the drawee is not a bank. Usually the last bank is also a presenting bank. § 8.4-105.1. Payable through or payable at bank; collecting bank. Text (a) If an item states that it is payable through a bank identified in the item, (i) the item designates the bank as a collecting bank and does not by itself authorize the bank to pay the item, and (ii) the item may be presented for payment only by or through t he bank. (b) If an item states that it is payable at a bank identified in the item, (i) the item designates that bank as a collecting bank and does not by itself authorize the bank to pay the item, and (ii) the item may be presented for payment only by or through the b ank. (c) If a draft names a nonbank drawee and it is unclear whether a bank named in the draft is a co-drawee or a collecting bank, the bank is a collecting bank. History History.

This section replaces former Sections 3-120 and 3-121. Some items are made payable through a particular bank. Subsection (a) states that such language makes the bank a collecting bank and not a payor bank. An item identifying a payable through bank can be presented for payment to the drawee only by the payable through bank. The item cannot be presented to the drawee over the counter f or immediate payment or by a collecting bank other than the payable through bank. 2. Subsection (b) retains the alternative approach of the present law. Under Alternative A a note payable at a bank is the equivalent of a draft drawn on the ban k and the midnight deadline provisions of Sections 4-301 and 4-302 apply. Under Alternative B a payable at bank is in the same position as a payable through bank under subsection (a). 3. Subsection (c) rejects the view of some cases that a bank named below the name of a drawee is itself a drawee. The commercial understanding is that this bank is a collecting bank and is not accountable under Section 4-302 for holding an item beyond its deadline. The liability of the bank is governed by Sections 4-202(a) and 4-103(e).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-106"><akn:num>§ 8.4-106</akn:num><akn:heading>Separate office of a bank</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A branch or separate office of a bank is a separate bank for the purpose of computing the time within which and determining the place at or to which action may be taken or notices or orders must be given under this title and under Title 8.3A. History History. 1964, c. 219; 1987, c. 180; 1992, c. 693. Annotations Editors note. This section corresponds to UCC § 4-107. OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. A rule with respect to the status of a branch or separate office of a bank as a part of any statute on bank collections is highly desirable if not absolutely n ecessary. However, practices in the operations of branches and separate offices vary substantially in the different states and it has not been possible to find any single rule that is logically correct, fair in all situations and workable under all diff erent types of practices. The decision not to draft the section with greater specificity leaves to the courts the resolution of the issues arising under this section on the basis of the facts of each case. 2. In many states and for many purposes a branch or separate office of the bank should be treated as a separate bank. Many branches function as separate banks in the handling and payment of items and require time for doing so similar to that of a separate bank. This is particularly true if branch banking is permitted throughout a state or in different towns and cities. Similarly, if there is this separate func tioning a particular branch or separate office is the only proper place for various types of action to be taken or orders or notices to be given. Examples include the drawing of a check on a particular branch by a customer whose account is carried at th at branch; the presentment of that same check at that branch; the issuance of an order to the branch to stop payment on the check. 3. Section 1 of the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code provided simply: A branch or office of any such bank shall be deemed a bank. Altho ugh this rule appears to be brief and simple, as applied to particular sections of the ABA Code it produces illogical and, in some cases, unreasonable results. For example, under Section 11 of the ABA Code it seems anomalous for one branch of a bank to have charged an item to the account of the drawer and another branch to have the power to elect to treat the item as dishonored. Similar logical problems would flow from applying the same rule to Article 4. Warranties by one branch to another branch und er Sections 4-207 and 4-208 (each considered a separate bank) do not make sense. 4. Assuming that it is not desirable to make each branch a separate bank for all purposes, this section provides that a branch or separate office is a separate ba nk for certain purposes. In so doing the single legal entity of the bank as a whole is preserved, thereby carrying with it the liability of the institution as a whole on such obligations as it may be under. On the other hand, in cases in which the Arti cle provides a number of time limits for different types of action by banks, if a branch functions as a separate bank, it should have the time limits available to a separate bank. Similarly if in its relations to customers a branch functions as a separa te bank, notices and orders with respect to accounts of customers of the branch should be given at the branch. For example, whether a branch has notice sufficient to affect its status as a holder in due course of an item taken by it should depend upon w hat notice that branch has received with respect to the item. Similarly the receipt of a stop-payment order at one branch should not be notice to another branch so as to impair the right of the second branch to be a holder in due course of the item, alt hough in circumstances in which ordinary care requires the communication of a notice or order to the proper branch of a bank, the notice or order would be effective at the proper branch from the time it was or should have been received. See Section 1-20 1(27). 5. The bracketed language (maintaining its own deposit ledger) in former Section 4-106 is deleted. Today banks keep records on customer accounts by elect ronic data storage. This has led most banks with branches to centralize to some degree their record keeping. The place where records are kept has little meaning if the information is electronically stored and is instantly retrievable at all branches of t he bank. Hence, the inference to be drawn from the deletion of the bracketed language is that where record keeping is done is no longer an important factor in determining whether a branch is a separate bank.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-107"><akn:num>§ 8.4-107</akn:num><akn:heading>Time of receipt of items</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) For the pu rpose of allowing time to process items, prove balances and make the necessary entries on its books to determine its position for the day, a bank may fix an afternoon hour of 2 p.m. or later as a cutoff hour for the handling of money and items and the ma king of entries on its books. (b) An item or deposit of money received on any day after a cutoff hour so fixed or after the close of the banking day may be treated as being received at the opening of the next banking day. History History. 1964, c. 219; 1992, c. 693. Annotations Editors note. This section corresponds to UCC § 4-108. OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Each of the huge volume of checks processed each day must go through a series of accounting procedures that consume time. Many banks have found it necessary t o establish a cutoff hour to allow time for these procedures to be completed within the time limits imposed by Article 4. Subsection (a) approves a cutoff hour of this type provided it is not earlier than 2 P.M. Subsection (b) provides that if such a cu toff hour is fixed, items received after the cutoff hour may be treated as being received at the opening of the next banking day. If the number of items received either through the mail or over the counter tends to taper off radically as the afternoon h ours progress, a 2 P.M. cutoff hour does not involve a large portion of the items received but at the same time permits a bank using such a cutoff hour to leave its doors open later in the afternoon without forcing into the evening the completion of its settling and proving process. 2. The provision in subsection (b) that items or deposits received after the close of the banking day may be treated as received at the opening of the next bankin g day is important in cases in which a bank closes at twelve or one oclock, e.g., on a Saturday, but continues to receive some items by mail or over the counter if, for example, it opens Saturday evening for the limited purpose of receiving deposits and cashing checks.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-108"><akn:num>§ 8.4-108</akn:num><akn:heading>Delays</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) Unless oth erwise instructed, a collecting bank in a good faith effort to secure payment of a specific item drawn on a payor other than a bank, and with or without the approval of any person involved, may, waive, modify or extend time limits imposed or permitted by this title for a period not exceeding two additional banking days without discharge of drawers or endorsers or liability to its transferor or any prior party. (b) Delay by a collecting bank or payor bank beyond time limits prescribed or permitted by this title or by instructions is excused if (i) the delay is caused by interruption of communication or computer facilities, suspension of payments by another bank, war, emergen cy conditions, failure of equipment or other circumstances beyond the control of the bank and (ii) the bank exercises such diligence as the circumstances require. History History. 1964, c. 219; 1992, c. 693. Annotations Editors note. This section corresponds to UCC § 4-109. OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Sections 4-202(b), 4-214, 4-301, and 4-302 prescribe various time limits for the handling of items. These are the limits of time within which a bank, in fulfi llment of its obligation to exercise ordinary care, must handle items entrusted to it for collection or payment. Under Section 4-103 they may be varied by agreement or by Federal Reserve regulations or operating circular, clearing-house rules, or the li ke. Subsection (a) permits a very limited extension of these time limits. It authorizes a collecting bank to take additional time in attempting to collect drafts drawn on nonbank payors with or without the approval of any interested party. The right o f a collecting bank to waive time limits under subsection (a) does not apply to checks. The two-day extension can only be granted in a good faith effort to secure payment and only with respect to specific items. It cannot be exercised if the customer in structs otherwise. Thus limited the escape provision should afford a limited degree of flexibility in special cases but should not interfere with the overall requirement and objective of speedy collections. 2. An extension granted under subsection (a) is without discharge of drawers or indorsers. It therefore extends the times for presentment or payment as specified in Article 3. 3. Subsection (b) is another escape clause from time limits. This clause operates not only with respect to time limits imposed by the Article itself but also time limits imposed by special instructions, by agreement or by Federal regulations or operating circulars, clearing-house rules or the like. The latter time limits are permitted by the Code. For example, a payor bank that fails to make timely retu rn of a dishonored item may be accountable for the amount of the item. Subsection (b) excuses a bank from this liability when its failure to meet its midnight deadline resulted from, for example, a computer breakdown that was beyond the control of the b ank, so long as the bank exercised the degree of diligence that the circumstances required. In Port City State Bank v. American National Bank, 486 F.2d 196 (10th Cir. 1973), the court held that a bank exercised sufficient diligence to be excused under t his subsection. If delay is sought to be excused under this subsection, the bank has the burden of proof on the issue of whether it exercised such diligence as the circumstances require. The subsection is consistent with Regulation CC, Section 229.38(e).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-109"><akn:num>§ 8.4-109</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1992, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>693, effective January 1, 1993.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-110"><akn:num>§ 8.4-110</akn:num><akn:heading>Electronic presentment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) Agreeme nt for electronic presentment means an agreement, clearing-house rule, or Federal Reserve regulation or operating circular, providing that presentment of an item may be made b y transmission of an image of an item or information describing the item (presentment notice) rather than delivery of the item itself.

(b) Presentmen t of an item pursuant to an agreement for presentment is made when the presentment notice is received. (c) If present ment is made by presentment notice, a reference to item or check in this title means the presentment notice unless the context otherwise indicates. History History. 1992, c. 693. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. An agreement for electronic presentment refers to an agreement under which presentment may be made to a payor bank by a presentment notice rather than by presentment of the item. Under imaging technology now under development, the presentment notice might be an image of the item. The electronic presentment agreement may provide that the item may be retained by a depositary bank, other collecting bank , or even a customer of the depositary bank, or it may provide that the item will follow the presentment notice. The identifying characteristic of an electronic presentment agreement is that presentment occurs when the presentment notice is received. An agreement for electronic presentment does not refer to the common case of retention of items by payor banks because the item itself is presented to the payor bank in these cases. Payor bank check retention is a matter of agreement between pay or banks and their customers. Provisions on payor bank check retention are found in Section 4-406(b). 2. The assumptions under which the electronic presentment amendments are based are as follows: No bank will participate in an electronic presentment program with out an agreement. These agreements may be either bilateral (Section 4-103(a)), under which two banks that frequently do business with each other may agree to depositary bank check retention, or multilateral (Section 4-103(b)), in which large segments of the banking industry may participate in such a program. In the latter case, federal or other uniform regulatory standards would likely supply the substance of the electronic presentment agreement, the application of which could be triggered by the use o f some form of identifier on the item. Regulation CC, Section 229.36(c) authorizes truncation agreements but forbids them from extending return times or otherwise varying requirements of the part of Regulation CC governing check collection without the ag reement of all parties interested in the check. For instance, an extension of return time could damage a depositary bank which must make funds available to its customers under mandatory availability schedules. The Expedited Funds Availability Act, 12 U .S.C. Section 4008(b)(2), directs the Federal Reserve Board to consider requiring that banks provide for check truncation. 3. The parties affected by an agreement for electronic presentment, with the exception of the customer, can be expected to protect themselves. For example, the p ayor bank can probably be expected to limit its risk of loss from drawer forgery by limiting the dollar amount of eligible items (Federal Reserve program), by reconcilement agreements (ABA Safekeeping program), by insurance (credit union share draft prog ram), or by other means. Because agreements will exist, only minimal amendments are needed to make clear that the UCC does not prohibit electronic presentment.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-111"><akn:num>§ 8.4-111</akn:num><akn:heading>Statute of limitations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text An action to enforce an obligation, duty, or right arising under this title must be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrues.

Marx, 246 Va. 384, 436 S.E.2d 447, 10 Va. Law Rep. 443, 1993 Va. LEXIS 137 (1993). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. This section states certain basic rules of the bank collection process. One basic rule, appearing in the last sentence of subsection (a), is that, to the exte nt applicable, the provisions of the Article govern without regard to whether a bank handling an item owns the item or is an agent for collection. Historically, much time has been spent and effort expended in determining or attempting to determine wheth er a bank was a purchaser of an item or merely an agent for collection. See discussion of this subject and cases cited in 11 A.L.R. 1043, 16 A.L.R. 1084, 42 A.L.R. 492, 68 A.L.R. 725, 99 A.L.R. 486. See also Section 4 of the American Bankers Associatio n Bank Collection Code. The general approach of Article 4, similar to that of other articles, is to provide, within reasonable limits, rules or answers to major problems known to exist in the bank collection process without regard to questions of status and ownership but to keep general principles such as status and ownership available to cover residual areas not covered by specific rules. In line with this approach, the last sentence of subsection (a) says in effect that Article 4 applies to practica lly every item moving through banks for the purpose of presentment, payment or collection. 2. Within this general rule of broad coverage, the first two sentences of subsection (a) state a rule of agency status. Unless a contrary intent clearly appea rs the status of a collecting bank is that of an agent or sub-agent for the owner of the item. Although as indicated in Comment 1 it is much less important under Article 4 to determine status than has been the case heretofore, status may have import ance in some residual areas not covered by specific rules. Further, since status has been considered so important in the past, to omit all reference to it might cause confusion. The status of agency applies regardless of the form of indorsement or l ack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn. Thus questions heretofore litigated as to whether ordinary indorsements for deposit, for collection or in blank have the effect of creating an agency status or a purchase, no longer have significance in varying the prima facie rule of agency. Similarly, the nature of the credit given for an item or whether it is subject to immediate withdrawal as of r ight or is in fact withdrawn, does not alter the agency status. See A.L.R. references supra in Comment 1. A contrary intent can change agency status but this must be clear. An example of a clear contrary intent would be if collateral papers established or the item bo re a legend stating that the item was sold absolutely to the depositary bank. 3. The prima facie agency status of collecting banks is consistent with prevailing law and practice today. Section 2 of the American Bankers Association Bank Col lection Code so provided. Legends on deposit tickets, collection letters and acknowledgments of items and Federal Reserve operating circulars consistently so provide. The status is consistent with rights of charge-back (Section 4-214 and Section 11 of the ABA Code) and risk of loss in the event of insolvency (Section 4-216 and Section 13 of the ABA Code). The right of charge-back with respect to checks is limited by Regulation CC, Section 226.36(d). 4. Affirmative statement of a prima facie agency status for collecting banks requires certain limitations and qualifications. Under current practices substantiall y all bank collections sooner or later merge into bank credits, at least if collection is effected. Usually, this takes place within a few days of the initiation of collection. An intermediary bank receives final collection and evidences the result of i ts collection by a credit on its books to the depositary bank. The depositary bank evidences the results of its collection by a credit in the account of its customer. As used in these instances the term credit clearly indicates a debtor-credit relationship. At some stage in the bank collection process the agency status of a collecting bank changes to that of debtor, a debtor of its customer. Usually at about the same time it also becomes a creditor for the amount of the item, a creditor of some intermediary, payor or other bank. Thus the collection is completed, all agency aspects are terminated and the identity of the item has become completely merged in bank accounts, that of the customer with the depositary bank and that o f one bank with another. Although Section 4-215(a) provides that an item is finally paid when the payor bank takes or fails to take certain action with respect to the item, the final paym ent of the item may or may not result in the simultaneous final settlement for the item in the case of all prior parties. If a series of provisional debits and credits for the item have been entered in accounts between banks, the final payment of the it em by the payor bank may result in the automatic firming up of all these provisional debits and credits under Section 4-215(c), and the consequent receipt of final settlement for the item by each collecting bank and the customer of the depositary bank si multaneously with such action of the payor bank. However, if the payor bank or some intermediary bank accounts for the item with a remittance draft, the next prior bank usually does not receive final settlement for the item until the remittance draft fi nally clears. See Section 4-213(c). The first sentence of subsection (a) provides that the agency status of a collecting bank (whether intermediary or depositary) continues until the settlement given by it for the item is or becomes final. In the case of the series of provisional credits covered by Section 4-215(c), this could be simultaneously with the final payment of the item by the payor bank. In cases in which remittance drafts are used or in straight noncash collections, this would not be unti l the times specified in Sections 4-213(c) and 4-215(d). With respect to checks Regulation CC Sections 229.31(c), 229.32(b) and 229.36(d) provide that all settlements between banks are final in both the forward collection and return of checks. Under Section 4-213(a) settlements for items may be made by any means agreed to by the parties. Since it is impossible to contemplate all the kinds of settlement s that will be utilized, no attempt is made in Article 4 to provide when settlement is final in all cases. The guiding principle is that settlements should be final when the presenting person has received usable funds. Section 4-213(c) and (d) and Sect ion 4-215(c) provide when final settlement occurs with respect to certain kinds of settlement, but these provisions are not intended to be exclusive. A number of practical results flow from the rule continuing the agency status of a collecting bank until its settlement for the item is or becomes final, some of which are specifically set forth in this Article. One is that risk of loss continues in the owner of the item rather than the agent bank. See Section 4-214. Offsetting rights favorable to the owner are that pending such final settlement, the owner has the preference rights of Section 4-216 and the direct rights of Section 4-302 against the payor bank. It also follows from this rule that the dollar limitations of Federal Deposit Insurance are measured by the claim of the owner of the item rather than that of the collecting bank. With respect to checks, rights of the parties in insolvency are determined by Regulation CC Section 229.39 and the liability of a bank handling a check to a subsequent bank that does not receive payment because of suspensio n of payments by another bank is stated in Regulation CC Section 229.35(b). 5. In those cases in which some period of time elapses between the final payment of the item by the payor bank and the time that the settlement of the collecting bank is or becomes final, e.g., if the payor bank or an intermediary bank accounts for the item with a remittance draft or in straight noncash colle...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-202"><akn:num>§ 8.4-202</akn:num><akn:heading>Responsibility for collection or return; when action timely</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) A collecti ng bank must exercise ordinary care in: (1) pres enting an item or sending it for presentment; (2) sending notice of dishonor or nonpayment or returning an item other than a documentary draft to the banks transferor after learning that the item has not been paid or accepted, as the case may be; (3) settling for an item when the bank receives final settlement; and (4) notifying its transferor of any loss or delay in transit within a reasonable time after discovery thereof.

CASE NOTES Priority in case of insolvent bank under former N.I.L.  See Lifsey v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 67 F.2d 82, 1933 U.S. App. LEXIS 4365 (4th Cir. 1933). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Subsection (a) states the basic responsibilities of a collecting bank. Of course, under Section 1-203 a collecting bank is subject to the standard requirement of good faith. By subsection (a) it must also use ordinary care in the exercise of its basic collection tasks. By Section 4-103(a) neither requirement may be disclaimed. 2. If the bank makes presentment itself, subsection (a)(1) requires ordinary care with respect both to the time and manner of presentment. (Sections 3-501 and 4- 212.) If it forwards the item to be presented the subsection requires ordinary care with respect to routing (Section 4-204), and also in the selection of intermediary banks or other agents. 3. Subsection (a) describes types of basic action with respect to which a collecting bank must use ordinary care. Subsection (b) deals with the time for taking a ction. It first prescribes the general standard for timely action, namely, for items received on Monday, proper action (such as forwarding or presenting) on Monday or Tuesday is timely. Although under current production line operations banks cu stomarily move items along on regular schedules substantially briefer than two days, the subsection states an outside time within which a bank may know it has taken timely action. To provide flexibility from this standard norm, the subsection further st ates that action within a reasonably longer time may be timely but the bank has the burden of proof. In the case of time items, action after the midnight deadline, but sufficiently in advance of maturity for proper presentation, is a clear example of a reasonably longer time that is timely. The standard of requiring action not later than Tuesday in the case of Monday items is also subject to possibilities of variation under the general provisions of Section 4-103, or under the special provisio ns regarding time of receipt of items (Section 4-108), and regarding delays (Section 4-109). This subsection (b) deals only with collecting banks. The time limits applicable to payor banks appear in Sections 4-301 and 4-302. 4. At common law the so-called New York collection rule subjected the initial collecting bank to liability for the actions of subsequent banks in the collection c hain; the so-called Massachusetts rule was that each bank, subject to the duty of selecting proper intermediaries, was liable only for its own negligence. Subsection (c) adopts the Massachusetts rule. But since this is stated to be subject to subsectio n (a)(1) a collecting bank remains responsible for using ordinary care in selecting properly qualified intermediary banks and agents and in giving proper instructions to them. Regulation CC Section 229.36(d) states the liability of a bank during the for ward collection of checks. VIRGINIA COMMENT This section is in accord with Code 1950, § 6-63, repealed by the act enacting the UCC, which authorizes direct forwarding to a payor bank for collection, in r equiring the collecting bank to use due diligence in other respects in the collection of the item. Under the UCC the collecting bank must use ordinary care in settling for an item when the bank has received final payment. This is in accord with the general view s expressed in First Wisconsin Natl Bank v. Peoples Natl Bank, 136 Va. 276, 284-88, 118 S.E. 82 (1923). In this case a collecting bank was found to be negligent in failing to remit proceeds of a draft collected from a non-bank payor, in that it held the proceeds for six days, during which time they were attached. The supreme court of appeals also thought the bank was negligent in not promptly informing its principal of an adverse claim to the proceeds; in not disclosing its agency to the cou rt during the attachment proceedings; and in neither employing counsel at its principals request, or notifying the principal of its refusal to do so. The UCC is silent as respects these other duties owed by a collecting bank to its principal. A collecting bank must use ordinary care in giving notice of dishonor or non-payment or returning the item after learning that it has not been paid or accepted. T his is in accord with the views expressed in Smith v. Bank of Glade Springs, 12 F.2d 535, 538-39 (4th Cir. 1926), in which it was held that the bank did exercise ordinary care and reasonable diligence in giving notice of dishonor.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-203"><akn:num>§ 8.4-203</akn:num><akn:heading>Effect of instructions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Subject to Title 8.3A concerning conversion of instruments (§ 8.3A-420) and restrictive endorsements (§ 8.3A-206), only a collecting banks transferor can give instructions that affect the bank or constitute notice to it, and a collecting bank is not liable to prior parties for any action taken pursuant to the instructions or in accordance with any agreement with its transferor. History History. 1964, c. 219; 1992, c. 693. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT This section adopts a chain of command theory which renders it unnecessary for an intermediary or collecting bank to determine whether its transferor is authorized to give the instructions. Equally the bank is not put on notice of any revocation of authority or lack of authority by notice received from any other person. The desirability of speed in the collection process and the fact that, by reason of advances made, the transferor may have the paramount interest in the item requires the rule. The section is made subject to the provisions of Article 3 concerning conversion of instruments (Section 3-420) and restrictive indorsements (Section 3-206). Of course instructions from or an agreement with its transferor does not relieve a collecting bank of its general obligation to exercise good faith and ordinary care. See Section 4-103(a). If in any particular case a bank has exercised good faith and ordin ary care and is relieved of responsibility by reason of instructions of or an agreement with its transferor, the owner of the item may still have a remedy for loss against the transferor (another bank) if such transferor has given wrongful instructions. The rules of the section are applied only to collecting banks. Payor banks always have the problem of making proper payment of an item; whether such payment is pr oper should be based upon all of the rules of Articles 3 and 4 and all of the facts of any particular case, and should not be dependent exclusively upon instructions from or an agreement with a person presenting the item.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-204"><akn:num>§ 8.4-204</akn:num><akn:heading>Methods of sending and presenting; sending directly to payor bank</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) A collecti ng bank shall send items by a reasonably prompt method, taking into consideration relevant instructions, the nature of the item, the number of those items on hand, the cost of collection involved and the method generally used by it or others to present t hose items.

Subsection (a) prescribes the general standards applicable to proper sending or forwarding of items. Because of the many types of methods available and the de sirability of preserving flexibility any attempt to prescribe limited or precise methods is avoided. 2. Subsection (b)(1) codifies the practice of direct mail, express, messenger or like presentment to payor banks. The practice is now country-wide and is justifi ed by the need for speed, the general responsibility of banks, Federal Deposit Insurance protection and other reasons. 3. Full approval of the practice of direct sending is limited to cases in which a bank is a payor. Since nonbank drawees or payors may be of unknown responsibili ty, substantial risks may be attached to placing in their hands the instruments calling for payments from them. This is obviously so in the case of documentary drafts. However, in some cities practices have long existed under clearing-house procedures t o forward certain types of items to certain nonbank payors. Examples include insurance loss drafts drawn by field agents on home offices. For the purpose of leaving the door open to legitimate practices of this kind, subsection (b)(3) affirmatively appr oves direct sending of any item other than documentary drafts to any nonbank payor, if authorized by Federal Reserve regulation or operating circular, clearing-house rule or the like. On the other hand subsection (b)(2) approves sending any item directly to a nonbank payor if authorized by a collecting banks transferor. This permits specia l instructions or agreements out of the norm and is consistent with the chain of command theory of Section 4-203. However, if a transferor other than the owner of the item, e.g., a prior collecting bank, authorizes a direct sending to a nonbank payor, such transferor assumes responsibility for the propriety or impropriety of such authorization. 4. Section 3-501(b) provides where presentment may be made. This provision is expressly subject to Article 4. Section 4-204(c) specifically approves presentment by a presenting bank at any place requested by the payor bank or other payor. The time when a check is received by a payor bank for presentment is governed by Regulation CC Section 229.36(b). VIRGINIA COMMENT The UCC is in accord with Code 1950, § 6-63, repealed by the act enacting the UCC, which authorizes a collecting bank to forward an item directly to the payor bank. The Virginia statute also gives a preference, if the payor bank fails before a check or draft given in payment is finally paid. Section 8.4-214 contains a more general provision regarding insolvency. See Virginia Comment to § 8.4-214. In Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond v. Peters, 139 Va. 45, 54, 123 S.E. 379 (1924), the supreme court of appeals said, When a bank receives from its correspon dent a check upon itself it is an agent for its correspondent to make a presentation to itself. The UCC accomplishes the same result, more directly.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-205"><akn:num>§ 8.4-205</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1992, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>693, effective January 1, 1993.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Cashiers check wrongfully dishonored where indorsement was missing.  Credit union was liable to a bank for wrongfully refusing to honor a cashiers check on presentment as the check was properly indorsed when a bank customer wro te its account number on the check for deposit; in light of the banks warranty under this section, there was no need to return the check to the bank to guarantee the missing endorsement of its customer as the customers endorsement was immaterial. Patriot Bank v. Navy Federal Credit Union, 58 Va. Cir. 251, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 25 (Fairfax County Feb. 26, 2002). OFFICIAL COMMENT Section 3-201(b) provides that negotiation of an instrument payable to order requires indorsement by the holder. The rule of former Section 4-205(1) was that the depositary bank may supply a missing indorsement of its customer unless the item contains the words payees indorsement required or the like. The cases have differed on the status of the depositary bank as a holder if it fails to supply its customers indorsement. Marine Midland Bank, N.A. v. Price, Miller, Evans &amp; Flowers, 446 N.Y.S.2d 797 (N.Y.App.Div. 4th Dept. 1981), revd, 455 N.Y.S.2d 565 (N.Y. 1982). It is common practice for depositary banks to receive unindorsed checks unde r so-called lock-box agreements from customers who receive a high volume of checks. No function would be served by requiring a depositary bank to run these items through a machine that would supply the customers indorsement except to afford the drawer and the subsequent banks evidence that the proceeds of the item reached the customers account. Paragraph (1) provides that the depositary bank becomes a holder when it takes the item for deposit if the depositor is a holder. Whether it sup plies the customers indorsement is immaterial. Paragraph (2) satisfies the need for a receipt of funds by the depositary bank by imposing on that bank a warranty that it paid the customer or deposited the item to the customers account. This warr anty runs not only to collecting banks and to the payor bank or nonbank drawee but also to the drawer, affording protection to these parties that the depositary bank received the item and applied it to the benefit of the holder.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-206"><akn:num>§ 8.4-206</akn:num><akn:heading>Transfer between banks</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Any agreed method that identifies the transferor bank is sufficient for the items further transfer to another bank.

Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT This section is designed to permit the simplest possible form of transfer from one bank to another, once an item gets in the bank collection chain, provided only identity of the transferor bank is preserved. This is important for tracing purposes and if recourse is necessary. However, since the responsibilities of the various banks appear in the Article it becomes unnecessary to have liability or responsibility depend on more formal indorsements. Simplicity in the form of transfer is conducive to speed. If the transfer is between banks, this section takes the place of the more formal requirements of Section 3-201.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-207"><akn:num>§ 8.4-207</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1992, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>693, effective January 1, 1993.

Transfer warranties. Text (a) A customer or collecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that: (1) the warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the item; (2) all signatures on the item are authentic and authorized; (3) the item has not been altered; (4) the item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment (§ 8.3A-305 (a)) of any party that can be asserted against the warrantor; and (5) the warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to the maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer. (b) If an item is dishonored, a customer or collecting bank transferring the item and receiving settlement or other consideration is obliged to pay the amount due on the item (i) according to the terms of the item at the time it was transferred, or (ii) if the transfe r was of an incomplete item, according to its terms when completed as stated in §§ 8.3A-115 and 8.3A-407. The obligation of a transferor is owed to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that takes the item in good faith. A transfer or cannot disclaim its obligation under this subsection by an endorsement stating that it is made without recourse or otherwise disclaiming liability. (c) A person t o whom the warranties under subsection (a) are made and who took the item in good faith may recover from the warrantor as damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered as a result of the breach, but not more than the amount of the i tem plus expenses and loss of interest incurred as a result of the breach. (d) The warran ties stated in subsection (a) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within thirty days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor , the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim. (e) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach. History History. 1992, c. 693. Annotations Editors note.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Except for subsection (b), this section conforms to Section 3-416 and extends its coverage to items. The substance of this section is discussed in the Comment to Section 3-416. Subsection (b) provides that customers or collecting banks that transfer items, whether by indorsement or not, undertake to pay the item if the item is dishonored.

With respect to checks, Regulation CC Section 229.34 states the warranties made by paying and returning banks. § 8.4-207.2. Presentment warranties. Text (a) If an unac cepted draft is presented to the drawee for payment or acceptance and the drawee pays or accepts the draft, (i) the person obtaining payment or acceptance, at the time of presentment, and (ii) a previous transferor of the draft, at the time of transfer, warrant to the drawee that pays or accepts the draft in good faith that: (1) the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the draft, a person entitled to enforce the draft or authorized to obtain payment or acceptance of the draft on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the draft; (2) the draft has not been altered; and (3) the warrantor has no knowledge that the signature of the purported drawer of the draft is unauthorized. (b) A drawee m aking payment may recover from a warrantor damages for breach of warranty equal to the amount paid by the drawee less the amount the drawee received or is entitled to receive from the drawer because of the payment. In addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and a loss of interest resulting from the breach. The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment. If the drawee accept s the draft (i) breach of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor, and (ii) if the acceptor makes payment with respect to the draft, the acceptor is entitled to recover from a warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts stated in this su bsection. (c) If a drawe e asserts a claim for breach of warranty under subsection (a) based on an unauthorized endorsement of the draft or an alteration of the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that the endorsement is effective under § 8.3A-404 or § 8.3A-405 or t he drawer is precluded under § 8.3A-406 or § 8.4-406 from asserting against the drawee the unauthorized endorsement or alteration. (d) If (i) a d ishonored draft is presented for payment to the drawer or an endorser or (ii) any other item is presented for payment to a party obliged to pay the item, and the item is paid, the person obtaining payment and a prior transferor of the item warrant to the person making payment in good faith that the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the item, a person entitled to enforce the item or authorized to obtain payment on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the item. The person maki ng payment may recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty an amount equal to the amount paid plus expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach. (e) The warran ties stated in subsections (a) and (d) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within thirty days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim. (f) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach. History History. 1992, c. 693. Annotations Editors note.

CASE NOTES No warranty of sufficient fund s on deposit.  The warranties set forth in subsection (1) of former § 8.4-207 (see now subsection (a)) and former § 8.3-417 (1) do not include a warranty that the drawer o f a check has sufficient funds on deposit to cover the check. Kirby v. First &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank, 210 Va. 88, 168 S.E.2d 273, 1969 Va. LEXIS 202 (1969). The term good title, within the meaning of subdivision (1)(a) of former § 8.4 -207 is not analogous to the concept of title in property law; instead, the term means only that a collecting bank is warranting that it is presenting a check whose indorsements appear to be genuine. Fairfax Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Crestar Bank, 247 Va. 356, 442 S.E.2d 651, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1178, 1994 Va. LEXIS 52 (1994). Under former § 8.4-207, the term good title carries a specialized construction limiting good title to the apparent validity of the chain of indorsement s; in other words, the warranty of good title is nothing more than an assurance that no one has better title to the check than the warrantor, and therefore, that no one is in a position to claim title as against the warrantee, as the payee or oth er owner of a genuine check could do if his indorsement were forged. Fairfax Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Crestar Bank, 247 Va. 356, 442 S.E.2d 651, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1178, 1994 Va. LEXIS 52 (1994). The rule that a drawee who mistakenly pays a check has recourse only against the drawer was firmly established before adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code. Kirby v. First &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank, 210 Va. 88, 168 S.E.2d 273, 1969 Va. LEXIS 202 (1969). The drawer of a check, and not the holder who receives payment, is primarily responsible for the drawing out of funds from a bank. An overdraft is an act by reaso n of which the drawer and not the holder obtains money from the bank on his check. The holder therefore in the absence of fraud or express understanding for repayment, has no concern with the question whether the drawer has funds in the bank to meet the check. The bank is estopped, as against him, from claiming that by its acceptance an overdraft occurred. A mere mistake is not sufficient to enable it to recover from him. Banks cannot always guard against fraud, but can guard against mistakes. It is the refore the general rule, sustained by almost universal authority, that a payment in the ordinary course of business of a check by a bank on which it is drawn under the mistaken belief that the drawer has funds in the bank subject to check is not such a p ayment under a mistake of fact as will permit the bank to recover the money so paid from the recipient of such payment. To permit the bank to repudiate the payment would destroy the certainty which must pertain to commercial transactions if they are to r emain useful to the business public.

Banks and Banking, §§ 67, 68; 3C M.J. Commerci al Law, §§ 99, 100, 101. OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Subsection (a) states a rational rule for the interest of a bank in an item. The customer of the depositary bank is normally the owner of the item and the sev eral collecting banks are agents of the customer (Section 4-201). A collecting agent may properly make advances on the security of paper held for collection, and acquires at common law a possessory lien for these advances. Subsection (a) applies an ana logous principle to a bank in the collection chain which extends credit on items in the course of collection. The bank has a security interest to the extent stated in this section. To the extent of its security interest it is a holder for value (Section s 3-303, 4-211) and a holder in due course if it satisfies the other requirements for that status (Section 3-302). Subsection (a) does not derogate from the bankers general common law lien or right of setoff against indebtedness owing in deposit acc ounts. See Section 1-103. Rather subsection (a) specifically implements and extends the principle as a part of the bank collection process. 2. Subsection (b) spreads the security interest of the bank over all items in a single deposit or received under a single agreement and a single giving of credit. It also adopts the first-in, first-out rule. 3. Collection statistics establish that the vast majority of items handled for collection are in fact collected. The first sentence of subsection (c) reflects th e fact that in the normal case the banks security interest is self-liquidating. The remainder of the subsection correlates the security interest with the provisions of Article 9, particularly for use in the cases of noncollection in which the securit y interest may be important. VIRGINIA COMMENT The UCC recognized that a bank has a security interest in an item or its proceeds to the extent that bank credit given on the basis of the item has been withdrawn . This is in accord with McAuley v. Morris Plan Bank, 155 Va. 777, 156 S.E. 418 (1931), which held that a bank was a taker for value, where bank credit has been withdrawn, even though the bank had a right of charge-back. This case appears by inference to overrule the approval given by the supreme court of appeals in Greensburg Natl Bank v. C. Syer &amp; Co., 113 Va. 53, 57, 73 S.E. 438 (1912), to a trial court instruction that included the following language: Checks or drafts deposited or credited, if intended to be for collection only do not become the property of the bank, even if the depositor has been allowed to check against the deposit before the paper is collected. In this case, in which an attaching drawee was held to be entitled to the proceeds of a draft rather that the depositary bank, it is not clear whether the bank credit was in fact withdrawn. In speaking of bank credit as value, the supreme court of appeals in Miller v. Norton, 114 Va. 609, 617, 77 S.E. 452 (1913), said: In this country, though the rule seems to be different in England, it is settled that the mere giving of credit to a depositors account of a check does not constitute the bank a holder for value, but in order to have that effect the credit must be drawn upon. The holding i n Fayette Natl Bank v. Summers, 105 Va. 689, 54 S.E. 862 (1906), in which a bank was not found to be a purchaser for value of a check on which payment had been stopped, is an earlier application of the same rule. Point 3 of the Official Comment to (former) § 8.3-303 is consistent with this Virginia rule, the comment referring to bank credit not drawn upon, which can be and is revoked when a claim or defense appears, as an example of what is not a taking for value. However, § 8.4-208(1)(b) recognizes that a bank may have a security interest in an item, and so have given value, if the credit is available for w ithdrawal as of right, whether or not drawn upon. Since the UCC does not make clear exactly what this provision is intended to cover, its effect on Miller v. Norton is not clear.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-209"><akn:num>§ 8.4-209</akn:num><akn:heading>When bank gives value for purposes of holder in due course</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text For purposes of determining its status as a holder in due course, a bank has given value to the extent it has a security interest in an item, if the bank otherwise comp lies with the requirements of § 8.3A-302 on what constitutes a holder in due course.

OFFICIAL COMMENT The section completes the thought of the previous section and makes clear that a security interest in an item is value for the purpose of determining the holders status as a holder in due course. The provision is in accord with the prior law (N.I.L. Section 27) and with Article 3 (Section 3-303). The section does not prescribe a security interest under Section 4-210 as a test of value general ly because the meaning of value under other Articles is adequately defined in Section 1-201. VIRGINIA COMMENT The UCC is in accord with McAuley v. Morris Plan Bank, 155 Va. 777, 156 S.E. 418 (1931), which held that a bank could be a holder in due course of a check, whethe r it was an absolute owner or had made advances by giving bank credit that had been drawn upon.

Text (a) With respe ct to settlement by a bank, the medium and time of settlement may be prescribed by Federal Reserve regulations or circulars, clearing-house rules, and the like, or agreement. In the absence of such prescription: (1) the medium of settlement is cash or credit to an account in a Federal Reserve bank of or specified by the person to receive settlement; and (2) the time of settlement, is: (i) with respect to tender of settlement by cash, a cashiers check, or tellers check, when the cash or check is sent or delivered; (ii) with respect to tender of settlement by credit in an account in a Federal Reserve Bank, when the credit is made; (iii) with respect to tender of settlement by a credit or debit to an account in a bank, when the credit or debit is made or, in the case of tender of settlement by authori ty to charge an account, when the authority is sent or delivered; or (iv) with respect to tender of settlement by a funds transfer, when payment is made pursuant to § 8.4A-406 (a) to the person receiving settlement. (b) If the ten der of settlement is not by a medium authorized by subsection (a) or the time of settlement is not fixed by subsection (a), no settlement occurs until the tender of settlement is accepted by the person receiving settlement. (c) If settlem ent for an item is made by cashiers check or tellers check and the person receiving settlement, before its midnight deadline: (1) pres ents or forwards the check for collection, settlement is final when the check is finally paid; or (2) fails to present or forward the check for collection, settlement is final at the midnight deadline of the person receiving settlement. (d) If settlem ent for an item is made by giving authority to charge the account of the bank giving settlement in the bank receiving settlement, settlement is final when the charge is made by the bank receiving settlement if there are funds available in the account for the amount of the item. History History. 1992, c. 693. Annotations Editors note. This section corresponds to UCC § 4-213. OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Subsection (a) sets forth the medium of settlement that the person receiving settlement must accept. In nearly all cases the medium of settlement will be dete rmined by agreement or by Federal Reserve regulations and circulars, clearing-house rules, and the like. In the absence of regulations, rules or agreement, the person receiving settlement may demand cash or credit in a Federal Reserve bank. If the perso n receiving settlement does not have an account in a Federal Reserve bank, it may specify the account of another bank in a Federal Reserve bank. In the unusual case in which there is no agreement on the medium of settlement and the bank making settlemen t tenders settlement other than cash or Federal Reserve bank credit, no settlement has occurred under subsection (b) unless the person receiving settlement accepts the settlement tendered. For example, if a payor bank, without agreement, tenders a telle rs check, the bank receiving the settlement may reject the check and return it to the payor bank or it may accept the check as settlement. 2. In several provisions of Article 4 the time that a settlement occurs is relevant. Subsection (a) sets out a general rule that the time of settlement, like the means of settlement, may be prescribed by agreement. In the absence of agreement, the time of settlement for tender of the common agreed media of settlement is that set out in subsection (a)(2). The time of settlement by cash, cashiers or teller s check or authority to charge an account is the time the cash, check or authority is sent, unless presentment is over the counter in which case settlement occurs upon delivery to the presenter. If there is no agreement on the time of settlement and the tender of settlement is not made by one of the media set out in subsection (a), under subsection (b) the time of settlement is the time the settlement is accepted by the person receiving settlement. 3. Subsections (c) and (d) are special provisions for settlement by remittance drafts and authority to charge an account in the bank receiving settlement. The re lationship between final settlement and final payment under Section 4-215 is addressed in subsection (b) of Section 4-215. With respect to settlement by cashiers checks or tellers checks, other than in response to over-the-counter presentment, t he bank receiving settlement can keep the risk that the check will not be paid on the bank tendering the check in settlement by acting to initiate collection of the check within the midnight deadline of the bank receiving settlement. If the bank fails t o initiate settlement before its midnight deadline, final settlement occurs at the midnight deadline, and the bank receiving settlement assumes the risk that the check will not be paid. If there is no agreement that permits the bank tendering settlement to tender a cashiers or tellers check, subsection (b) allows the bank receiving the check to reject it, and, if it does, no settlement occurs. However, if the bank accepts the check, settlement occurs and the time of final settlement is governed by subsection (c). With respect to settlement by tender of authority to charge the account of the bank making settlement in the bank receiving settlement, subsection (d) provides th at final settlement does not take place until the account charged has available funds to cover the amount of the item. If there is no agreement that permits the bank tendering settlement to tender an authority to charge an account as settlement, subsect ion (b) allows the bank receiving the tender to reject it. However, if the bank accepts the authority, settlement occurs and the time of final settlement is governed by subsection (d). VIRGINIA COMMENT A collecting bank may take from a payor other than a bank in settlement of an item a cashiers check, certified check or obligation.

If the return or notice is delayed beyond the banks midnight deadline or a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts, the bank may revoke the settlement, charge-back the cred it or obtain a refund from its customer, but it is liable for any loss resulting from the delay. These rights to revoke, charge-back and obtain refund terminate if and when a settlement for the item received by the bank is or becomes final. (b) A collecti ng bank returns an item when it is sent or delivered to the banks customer or transferor or pursuant to its instructions.

History History. 1964, c. 219; 1992, c. 693. Annotations Editors note. This section corresponds to UCC § 4-214. OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Under current bank practice, in a major portion of cases banks make provisional settlement for items when they are first received and then await subsequent det ermination of whether the item will be finally paid. This is the principal characteristic of what are referred to in banking parlance as cash items. Statistically, this practice of settling provisionally first and then awaiting final payment is justified because the vast majority of such cash items are finally paid, with the result that in this great preponderance of cases it becomes unnecessary for the banks making the provisional settlements to make any further entries. In due course the pr ovisional settlements become final simply with the lapse of time. However, in those cases in which the item being collected is not finally paid or if for various reasons the bank making the provisional settlement does not itself receive final payment, p rovision is made in subsection (a) for the reversal of the provisional settlements, charge-back of provisional credits and the right to obtain refund. 2. Various causes of a banks not receiving final payment, with the resulting right of charge-back or refund, are stated or suggested in subsection (a). These include dishonor of the original item; dishonor of a remittance instrument given for it; reversal of a provisional credit for the item; suspension of payments by another bank. The causes stated are illustrative; the right of charge-back or refund is st ated to exist whether the failure to receive final payment in ordinary course arises through one of them or otherwise. 3. The right of charge-back or refund exists if a collecting bank has made a provisional settlement for an item with its customer but terminates if and when a set tlement received by the bank for the item is or becomes final. If the bank fails to receive such a final settlement the right of charge-back or refund must be exercised promptly after the bank learns the facts. The right exists (if so promptly exercise d) whether or not the bank is able to return the item. The second sentence of subsection (a) adopts the view of Appliance Buyers Credit Corp. v. Prospect National Bank, 708 F.2d 290 (7th Cir. 1983), that if the midnight deadline for returning an item or giving notice is not met, a collecting bank loses its rights only to the extent of damages for any loss resulting from the delay. 4. Subsection (b) states when an item is returned by a collecting bank. Regulation CC, Section 229.31 preempts this subsection with respect to checks by allowing direct return to the depositary bank. Because a returned check may follow a different path than in forward collection, settlement given for the check is final and not provisional except as between the depositary bank and its customer. Regulation CC Sec tion 229.36(d). See also Regulations CC Sections 229.31(c) and 229.32(b). Thus owing to the federal preemption, this subsection applies only to noncheck items. 5. The rule of subsection (d) relating to charge-back (as distinguished from claim for refund) applies irrespective of the cause of the nonpayment, and of the per son ultimately liable for nonpayment. Thus charge-back is permitted even if nonpayment results from the depositary banks own negligence. Any other rule would result in litigation based upon a claim for wrongful dishonor of other checks of the custome r, with potential damages far in excess of the amount of the item. Any other rule would require a bank to determine difficult questions of fact. The customers protection is found in the general obligation of good faith (Sections 1-203 and 4-103). If bad faith is established the customers recovery includes other damages, if any, suffered by the party as a proximate consequence (Section 4-103(e); see also Section 4-402). 6. It is clear that the charge-back does not relieve the bank from any liability for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling the item. The measure of damag es for such failure is stated in Section 4-103(e). 7. Subsection (f) states a rule fixing the time for determining the rate of exchange if there is a charge-back or refund of a credit given in dollars for an item payable in a foreign currency. Compare Section 3-107. Fixing such a rule is desirable to avoid disputes. If in any case the parties wish to fix a different time for determining the rate of exchange, they may do so by agreement.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-213"><akn:num>§ 8.4-213</akn:num><akn:heading>Final payment of item by payor bank; when provisional debits and credits become final; when certain credits become available for withdrawal</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) An item is finally paid by a payor bank when the bank has first done any of the following: (1) paid the item in cash; (2) settled for the item without having a right to revoke the settlement under statute, clearing-house rule, or agreement; or (3) made a provisional settlement for the item and failed to revoke the settlement in the time and manner permitted by statute, clearing-house rule or agreement.

CASE NOTES Requirement of good faith by person receiving credit.  Title 8.4 neither specifically addresses nor excludes recovery by a bank after final payment when the person receiving the credit acted in bad faith.

LEXIS 185 (1977). The Uniform Commercial Code permits the payor bank to provisionally post a customers account on the day a check is received for payment. The provisional posting is not final payment and may be reversed by returning the check prior to the banks midnight deadline. Bagheri v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 1071, 408 S.E.2d 259, 8 Va. L aw Rep. 440, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 275 (1991). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. By the definition and use of the term settle (Section 4-104(a)(11)) this Article recognizes that various debits or credits, remittances, settlements or payments given for an item may be either provisional or final, that settlements sometimes are provisional and sometimes are final and sometimes are provisional for awhile but later become final. Subsection (a) defines when settlement for an item constit utes final payment. Final payment of an item is important for a number of reasons. It is one of several factors determining the relative priorities between items and notices, stop-pa yment orders, legal process and setoffs (Section 4-303). It is the end of the line in the collection process and the turn around point commencing the return flow of proceeds. It is the point at which many provisional settlements become final. See Section 4-215(c). Final payment of an item by the payor bank fixes preferential rights under Section 4-216. 2. If an item being collected moves through several states, e.g., is deposited for collection in California, moves through two or three California banks to the Fe deral Reserve Bank of San Francisco, to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, to a payor bank in Maine, the collection process involves the eastward journey of the item from California to Maine and the westward journey of the proceeds from Maine to Califor nia. Subsection (a) recognizes that final payment does not take place, in this hypothetical case, on the journey of the item eastward. It also adopts the view that neither does final payment occur on the journey westward because what in fact is journeyi ng westward are proceeds of the item. 3. Traditionally and under various decisions payment in cash of an item by a payor bank has been considered final payment. Subsection (a)(1) recognizes and provid es that payment of an item in cash by a payor bank is final payment. 4. Section 4-104(a)(11) defines settle as meaning to pay in cash, by clearing-house settlement, in a charge or credit or by remittance, or otherwise a s agreed. A settlement may be either provisional or final. Subsection (a)(2) of Section 4-215 provides that an item is finally paid by a payor bank when the bank has settled for the item without having a right to revoke the settlement under sta tute, clearing-house rule or agreement. Former subsection (1)(b) is modified by subsection (a)(2) to make clear that a payor bank cannot make settlement provisional by unilaterally reserving a right to revoke the settlement. The right must come fro m a statute (e.g., Section 4-301), clearing-house rule or other agreement. Subsection (a)(2) provides in effect that if the payor bank finally settles for an item this constitutes final payment of the item. The subsection operates if nothing has occurr ed and no situation exists making the settlement provisional. If under statute, clearing-house rule or agreement, a right of revocation of the settlement exists, the settlement is provisional. Conversely, if there is an absence of a right to revoke und er statute, clearing-house rule or agreement, the settlement is final and such final settlement constitutes final payment of the item. A primary example of a statutory right on the part of the payor bank to revoke a settlement is the right to revoke conferred by Section 4-301. The underlying the ory and reason for deferred posting statutes (Section 4-301) is to require a settlement on the date of receipt of an item but to keep that settlement provisional with the right to revoke prior to the midnight deadline. In any case in which Section 4-301 is applicable, any settlement by the payor bank is provisional solely by virtue of the statute, subsection (a)(2) of Section 4-215 does not operate, and such provisional settlement does not constitute final payment of the item. With respect to checks, Regulation CC Section 229.36(d) provides that settlement between banks for the forward collection of checks is final. The relationship of this provision to Article 4 is discussed in the Commentary to that section. A second important example of a right to revoke a settlement is that arising under clearing-house rules. It is very common for clearing-house rules to provide th at items exchanged and settled for in a clearing (e.g., before 10:00 a.m. on Monday) may be returned and the settlements revoked up to but not later than 2:00 p.m. on the same day (Monday) or under deferred posting at some hour on the next business day ( e.g., 2:00 p.m. Tuesday). Under this type of rule the Monday morning settlement is provisional and being provisional does not constitute a final payment of the item. An example of an agreement allowing the payor bank to revoke a settlement is a case in which the payor bank is also the depositary bank and has signed a receipt o r duplicate deposit ticket or has made an entry in a passbook acknowledging receipt, for credit to the account of A, of a check drawn on it by B. If the receipt, deposit ticket, passbook or other agreement with A is to the effect that any credit so ente red is provisional and may be revoked pending the time required by the payor bank to process the item to determine if it is in good form and there are funds to cover it, the agreement keeps the receipt or credit provisional and avoids its being either fi nal settlement or final payment. The most important application of subsection (a)(2) is that in which presentment of an item has been made over the counter for immediate payment. In this case Se ction 4-301(a) does not apply to make the settlement provisional, and final payment has occurred unless a rule or agreement provides otherwise. 5. Former Section 4-213(1)(c) provided that final payment occurred when the payor bank completed the process of posting. The term was defined in former S ection 4-109. In the present Article, Section 4-109 has been deleted and the process-of-posting test has been abandoned in Section 4-215(a) for determining when final payment is made. Difficulties in determining when the events described in former Sect ion 4-109 take place make the process-of-posting test unsuitable for a system of automated check collection or electronic presentment. 6. The last sentence of former Section 4-213(1) is deleted as an unnecessary source of confusion. Initially the view that payor bank may be accountable for, that is, liable for the amount of, an item that it has already paid seems incongruous.

Banks and Banking, § 96. OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. The underlying purpose of the provisions of this section is not to confer upon banks, holders of items or anyone else preferential positions in the event of b ank failures over general depositors or any other creditors of the failed banks. The purpose is to fix as definitely as possible the cut-off point of time for the completion or cessation of the collection process in the case of items that happen to be i n the process at the time a particular bank suspends payments. It must be remembered that in bank collections as a whole and in the handling of items by an individual bank, items go through a whole series of processes. It must also be remembered that at any particular point of time a particular bank (at least one of any size) is functioning as a depositary bank for some items, as an intermediary bank for others, as a presenting bank for still others and as a payor bank for still others, and that when i t suspends payments it will have close to its normal load of items working through its various processes. For the convenience of receivers, owners of items, banks, and in fact substantially everyone concerned, it is recognized that at the particular mom ent of time that a bank suspends payment, a certain portion of the items being handled by it have progressed far enough in the bank collection process that it is preferable to permit them to continue the remaining distance, rather than to send them back and reverse the many entries that have been made or the steps that have been taken with respect to them. Therefore, having this background and these purposes in mind, the section states what items must be turned backward at the moment suspension interve nes and what items have progressed far enough that the collection process with respect to them continues, with the resulting necessary statement of rights of various parties flowing from this prescription of the cut-off time. 2. The rules stated are similar to those stated in the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code, but with the abandonment of any theory of trust. On th e other hand, some law previous to this Act may be relevant. See Note, Uniform Commercial Code: Stopping Payment of an Item Deposited with an Insolvent Depositary Bank, 40 Okla. L. Rev. 689 (1987). Although for practical purposes Federal Deposit Insur ance affects materially the result of bank failures on holders of items and banks, no attempt is made to vary the rules of the section by reason of such insurance. 3. It is recognized that in view of Jennings v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 294 U.S. 216, 55 S. Ct. 394, 79 L. Ed. 869, 99 A.L.R. 1248 (1935), amendme nt of the National Bank Act would be necessary to have this section apply to national banks. But there is no reason why it should not apply to others. See Section 1-108. VIRGINIA COMMENT Code 1950, § 6-63, repealed by the act enacting the UCC, in terms covers only situations in which items have been forwarded directly to the payor bank for coll ection. The UCC section is not so limited. It may be, however, that the Virginia statute was as comprehensive since any situation in which a remittance is used might be considered an example of direct forwarding. The UCC accords with prior Virginia law under which the owner of an item has a preference when a bank collects the item and because of insolvency fails to remit t he proceeds. Webb v. OGeary, 145 Va. 356, 133 S.E. 568 (1926); Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond v. Peters, 139 Va. 45, 54-69, 123 S.E. 379 (1924); Miller v. Norton, 114 Va. 609, 617-18, 77 S.E. 452 (1913); First Natl Bank v. Payne &amp; Co.s Assi gnees, 85 Va. 890, 9 S.E. 153 (1898). The UCC does not cover the subject of whether the right of set-off against a bank operates as a preference. See Dickenson v. Charles, 173 Va. 393, 405, 4 S.E.2d 3 51 (1939). The UCC does not affect the holding in Lifsey v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 67 F.2d 82 (4th Cir. 1933), in which a preference was denied in the assets of a bank to which a note had been forwarded for collection, but which failed before it had done anything with a check given by its depositor in payment of the note, the depositor at the time being indebted to the bank in a greater amount than his deposit. The UCC permits the owner to recover an item not finally paid because of insolvency of a payor or collecting bank. In Fine v. Receiver of Dickenson County Bank, 1 63 Va. 157, 175 S.E. 863, 94 A.L.R. 1393 (1934), the depositor tried to stop payment on a check, when the depositary bank failed before it was collected. The check was eventually paid to the insolvent bank, but the depositor was permitted to recover the entire amount of the check from the insolvent bank, since the deposit slip showed that the bank was acting as a collection agent for the owner as its principal. The UCC would give the same result, although it would seem the owner should be able to stop p ayment and recover the item itself. PART 3. Collection of Items: Payor Banks. -360§ 8.4-301.

CASE NOTES The Uniform Commercial Code permits the payor bank to provisionally post a customers account on the day a check is received for payment. The provisional posting is not final payment and may be reversed by returning the check prior to the banks midnight deadline. Bagheri v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 1071, 408 S.E.2d 259, 8 Va. L aw Rep. 440, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 275 (1991). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. The term deferred posting appears in the caption of Section 4-301. This refers to the practice permitted by statute in most of the states before the UCC under which a payor bank receives items on one day but does not post the items to the customers account until the next day. Items dishonored were then returned after the posting on the day after receipt. Under Section 4-301 the concept of d eferred posting merely allows a payor bank that has settled for an item on the day of receipt to return a dishonored item on the next day before its midnight deadline, without regard to when the item was actually posted. With respect to checks Regul ation CC Section 229.30(c) extends the midnight deadline under the UCC under certain circumstances. See the Commentary to Regulation CC Section 229.38(d) on the relationship between the UCC and Regulation CC on settlement. 2. The function of this section is to provide the circumstances under which a payor bank that has made timely settlement for an item may return the item and revo ke the settlement so that it may recover any settlement made. These circumstances are: (1) the item must be a demand item other than a documentary draft; (2) the item must be presented otherwise than for immediate payment over the counter; and (3) the payor bank must return the item (or give notice if the item is unavailable for return) before its midnight deadline and before it has paid the item. With respect to checks, see Regulation CC Section 229.31(f) on notice in lieu of return an Regulation CC Section 229.33 as to the different requirement of notice of nonpayment. An instance of when an item may be unavailable for return arises under a collecting bank check retention plan under which presentment is made by a presentment notice and the item i s retained by the collecting bank. Subsection 4-215(a)(2) provides that final payment occurs if the payor bank has settled for an item without a right to revoke the settlement under statute, clearing-house rule or agreement. In any case in which Section 4-301(a) is applicable, the payor bank has a right to revoke the settlement by statute; therefore, Section 4-215(a)(2) is inoperable, and the settlement is provisional. Hence, if the settlement is not over the counter and the payor bank settles in a ma nner that does not constitute final payment, the payor bank can revoke the settlement by returning the item before its midnight deadline. 3. The relationship of Section 4-301(a) to final settlement and final payment under Section 4-215 is illustrated by the following case. Depositary Bank sends by mail an item to Payor Bank with instructions to settle by remitting a tellers check drawn on a bank in the city where Depositary Bank is located. Payor Bank sends the tellers check on the day the item was presented. Having made timely settleme nt, under the deferred posting provisions of Section 4-301(a), Payor Bank may revoke that settlement by returning the item before its midnight deadline. If it fails to return the item before its midnight deadline, it has finally paid the item if the ban k on which the tellers check was drawn honors the check. But if the tellers check is dishonored there has been no final settlement under Section 4-213(c) and no final payment under Section 4-215(b). Since the Payor Bank has neither paid the ite m nor made timely return, it is accountable for the item under Section 4-302(a). 4. The time limits for action imposed by subsection (a) are adopted by subsection (b) for cases in which the payor bank is also the depositary bank, but in this case the requirement of a settlement on the day of receipt is omitted. 5. Subsection (c) fixes a base point from which to measure the time within which notice of dishonor must be given. See Section 3-503. 6. Subsection (d) leaves banks free to agree upon the manner of returning items but establishes a precise time when an item is returned. For definition of sent as used in paragraphs (1) and (2) see Section 1-201(38). Obviously the subsection assumes that the item has not been finally paid under Section 4-215(a). If it has been, this provision has no operation. 7. The fact that an item has been paid under proposed Section 4-215 does not preclude the payor bank from asserting rights of restitution or revocation under Sec tion 3-418. National Savings and Trust Co. v. Park Corp., 722 F.2d 1303 (6th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 939 (1984), is the correct interpretation of the present law on this issue. VIRGINIA COMMENT The deferred posting sections of the UCC carry out the same basic purposes as the prior Virginia statutes. Code 1950, § 6-543.1, repealed by the act enacting t he UCC applies when the bank, gives credit therefor before midnight of the day of receipt. The term credit is then defined in Code 1950, § 6-543.2, repealed by the act enacting the UCC, as including payment, remittance, advice of c redit, or authorization to charge and, in case where the item is received for deposit as well as for payment, also includes the making of appropriate entries to the receiving banks general ledger without regard to whether the item is posted to indivi dual customers ledgers. While the UCC uses different terminology, there are no apparent significant differences as compared with the prior Virginia statutes.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-302"><akn:num>§ 8.4-302</akn:num><akn:heading>Payor banks responsibility for late return of item</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) If an item is presented and received by a payor bank, the bank is accountable for the amount to: (1) a de mand item, other than a documentary draft, whether properly payable or not if the bank, in any case where it is not also the depositary bank, retains the item beyond midnight of the banking day of receipt without settling for it or, regardless of whether it is also the depositary bank, does not pay or return the item or send notice of dishonor until after its midnight deadline; or (2) any other properly payable item unless, within the time allowed for acceptance or payment of that item, the bank either accepts or pays the item or returns it and accompanying docum ents. (b) The liabil ity of a payor bank to pay an item pursuant to subsection (a) is subject to defenses based on breach of a presentment warranty (§ 8.4-207.2) or proof that the person seeking enforcement of the liability presented or transferred the item for the purpos e of defrauding the payor bank.

Annotations CASE NOTES Strict liability.  It is well established that this provision imposes strict liability on payor banks for failure to meet the midnight deadline requirement. Equally well est ablished is that the purpose of this sections strict liability rule is to satisfy the need for finality and certainty in business transactions. American Title Ins. Co. v. Burke &amp; Herbert Bank &amp; Trust Co., 813 F. Supp. 423, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2167 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, 25 F.3d 1038, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 20790 (4th Cir. 1994). Who may sue payor bank.  The Code does not specify with precision who may sue a payor bank for violation of the midnight deadline requirement. At best, the Official Comment makes the obvi ous point that an entity must have some direct connection with the check collection and payment process in order to bring suit. American Title Ins. Co. v. Burke &amp; Herbert Bank &amp; Trust Co., 813 F. Supp. 423, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2167 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff 'd, 25 F.3d 1038, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 20790 (4th Cir. 1994). Where a payor bank delays returning a dishonored check, liability for the face amount of the check is imposed on payor bank without regard to whether any damages have been sustained as a result of banks failure to make a timely return. American Title Ins. Co. v. Burke &amp; Herbert Bank &amp; Trust Co., 813 F. Supp. 423, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2 167 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, 25 F.3d 1038, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 20790 (4th Cir. 1994). Where a party becomes a holder, transferee and assignee of checks after their untimely return by a payor bank, that party has no standing to bring a cause of action for the banks violation of this section. Limiting standing in this manner does not, in any way, diminish the deterrent sting of the strict liability rule, for it simply entrusts enforcement of this rule to those with the greatest incentive to enforce compliance. American Title Ins. Co. v. Burke &amp; Herbert Bank &amp; Trust Co., 813 F. Supp. 423, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2167 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, 25 F.3d 1038, 1994 U.S. App. L EXIS 20790 (4th Cir. 1994). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Subsection (a)(1) continues the former law distinguishing between cases in which the payor bank is not also the depositary bank and those in which the payor b ank is also the depositary bank (on us items). For on us items the payor bank is accountable if it retains the item beyond its midnight deadline without settling for it. If the payor bank is not the depositary bank it is accountable if i t retains the item beyond midnight of the banking day of receipt without settling for it. It may avoid accountability either by settling for the item on the day of receipt and returning the item before its midnight deadline under Section 4-301 or by ret urning the item on the day of receipt. This rule is consistent with the deferred posting practice authorized by Section 4-301 which allows the payor bank to make provisional settlement for an item on the day of receipt and to revoke that settlement by r eturning the item on the next day. With respect to checks, Regulation CC Section 229.36(d) provides that settlements between banks for forward collection of checks are final when made. See the Commentary on that provision for its effect on the UCC. 2. If the settlement given by the payor bank does not become final, there has been no payment under Section 4-215(b), and the payor bank giving the failed settle ment is accountable under subsection (a)(1) of Section 4-302. For instance, the payor bank makes provisional settlement by sending a tellers check that is dishonored. In such a case settlement is not final under Section 4-213(c) and no payment occur s under Section 4-215(b). Payor bank is accountable on the item. The general principle is that unless settlement provides the presenting bank with usable funds, settlement has failed and the payor bank is accountable for the amount of the item. 3. Subsection (b) is an elaboration of the deleted introductory language of former Section 4-302: In the absence of a valid defense such as breach of a pres entment warranty (subsection (1) of Section 4-207), settlement effected or the like . . . . A payor bank can defend an action against it based on accountability by showing that the item contained a forged indorsement or a fraudulent alteration. Sub section (b) drops the ambiguous or the like language and provides that the payor bank may also raise the defense of fraud. Decisions that hold an accountable banks liability to be absolute are rejected. A payor bank that makes a late return of an item should not be liable to a defrauder operating a check-kiting scheme. In Bank of Leumi Trust Co. v. Ballys Park Place Inc., 528 F. Supp. 349 (S.D.N.Y. 1981), and American National Bank v. Foodbasket, 497 P.2d 546 (Wyo. 1972), banks that were accountable under Section 4-302 for missing their midnight deadline were successful in defending against parties who initiated collection knowing that the check would not be paid. The settlement effected language is deleted as unneces sary. If a payor bank is accountable for an item it is liable to pay it. If it has made final payment for an item, it is no longer accountable for the item.

The Writ Firea Facies: Execution. § 3.2 Execution. Rendleman. OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. While a payor bank is processing an item presented for payment, it may receive knowledge or a legal notice affecting the item, such as knowledge or a notice t hat the drawer has filed a petition in bankruptcy or made an assignment for the benefit of creditors; may receive an order of the drawer stopping payment on the item; may have served on it an attachment of the account of the drawer; or the bank itself ma y exercise a right of setoff against the drawers account. Each of these events affects the account of the drawer and may eliminate or freeze all or part of whatever balance is available to pay the item. Subsection (a) states the rule for determining the relative priorities between these various legal events and the item. 2. The rule is that if any one of several things has been done to the item or if it has reached any one of several stages in its processing at the time the knowl edge, notice, stop-payment order or legal process is received or served and a reasonable time for the bank to act thereon expires or the setoff is exercised, the knowledge, notice, stop-payment order, legal process or setoff comes too late, the item has priority and a charge to the customers account may be made and is effective. With respect to the effect of the customers bankruptcy, the banks rights are governed by Bankruptcy Code Section 542(c) which codifies the result of Bank of Marin v . England, 385 U.S. 99 (1966).Section 4-405 applies to the death or incompetence of the customer. 3. Once a payor bank has accepted or certified an item or has paid the item in cash, the event has occurred that determines priorities between the item and the v arious legal events usually described as the four legals. Paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) so provide. If a payor bank settles for an item presented over the counter for immediate payment by a cashiers check or tellers check whi ch the presenting person agrees to accept, paragraph (3) of subsection (a) would control and the event determining priority has occurred. Because presentment was over the counter, Section 4-301(a) does not apply to give the payor bank the statutory right to revoke the settlement. Thus the requirements of paragraph (3) have been met unless a clearing-house rule or agreement of the parties provides otherwise. 4. In the usual case settlement for checks is by entries in bank accounts. Since the process-of-posting test has been abandoned as inappropriate for automated c heck collection, the determining event for priorities is a given hour on the day after the item is received. (Paragraph (5) of subsection (a).) The hour may be fixed by the bank no earlier than one hour after the opening on the next banking day after th e bank received the check and no later than the close of that banking day. If an item is received after the payor banks regular Section 4-108 cutoff hour, it is treated as received the next banking day. If a bank receives an item after its regular cutoff hour on Monday and an attachment is levied at noon on Tuesday, the attachment is prior to the item if the bank had not before that hour taken the action described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a). The Commentary to Regulation CC S ection 229.36(d) explains that even though settlement by a paying bank for a check is final for Regulation CC purposes, the paying banks right to return the check before its midnight deadline under the UCC is not affected. 5. Another event conferring priority for an item and a charge to the customers account based upon the item is stated by the language become accountable f or the amount of the item under Section 4-302 dealing with the payor banks responsibility for late return of items. Expiration of the deadline under Section 4-302 with resulting accountability by the payor bank for the amount of the item, establ ishes priority of the item over notices, stop-payment orders, legal process or setoff. 6. In the case of knowledge, notice, stop-payment orders and legal process the effective time for determining whether they were received too late to affect the p ayment of an item and a charge to the customers account by reason of such payment, is receipt plus a reasonable time for the bank to act on any of these communications. Usually a relatively short time is required to communicate to the accounting depa rtment advice of one of these events but certainly some time is necessary. Compare Sections 1-201(27) and 4-403. In the case of setoff the effective time is when the setoff is actually made. 7. As between one item and another no priority rule is stated. This is justified because of the impossibility of stating a rule that would be fair in all cases, having in mind the almost infinite number of combinations of large and small checks in relation to the available balance on hand in the drawers account; the possible methods of receipt; and other variables. Further, the drawer has drawn all the che cks, the drawer should have funds available to meet all of them and has no basis for urging one should be paid before another; and the holders have no direct right against the payor or bank in any event, unless of course, the bank has accepted, certified or finally paid a particular item, or has become liable for it under Section 4-302. Under subsection (b) the bank has the right to pay items for which it is itself liable ahead of those for which it is not.

An item is properly payable if it is authorized by the customer and is in accordance with any agreement between the customer and the bank. (b) A customer is not liable for the amount of an overdraft if the customer neither signed the item nor benefited from the proceeds of the item. (c) A bank may charge against the account of a customer a check that is otherwise properly payable from the account, even though payment was made before the date of the check, unless the customer has given notice to the bank of the postdating describing the check with reasonable certainty. The notice is effective for the period stated in § 8.4-403 (b) for stop-payment orders, and must be received at such time and in such manner as to afford the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank takes any action with respect to the check described in § 8.4-303. If a bank charges against the account of a customer a check before the date stated in the notice of postdating, the bank is liable for damages for the loss resulting from its act. The loss may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under § 8.4-402. (d) A bank tha t in good faith makes payment to a holder may charge the indicated account of its customer according to: (1) the original terms of the altered item; or (2) the terms of the completed item, even though the bank knows the item has been completed unless the bank has notice that the completion was improper.

CASE NOTES Authority to c harge worthless check discretionary.  The authority of a Virginia bank to charge a worthless check against a customers account, even though the charge creates an overdraft, is discretionary. Warre n v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 416, 247 S.E.2d 692, 1978 Va. LEXIS 198 (1978). And criminal actions not excused by banks refusal to do so.  The refusal of a bank to exercise the authority to charge a worthless check against a customers account even though such charge would create an overdraft did not excuse the actions of the customer in presenting a worthless check, where those actions were otherwise criminally actionable under the Bad Check Law. Warren v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 416, 247 S.E.2d 692, 1978 Va. LEXIS 198 (1978). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. An item is properly payable from a customers account if the customer has authorized the payment and the payment does not violate any agreement that may ex ist between the bank and its customer. For an example of a payment held to violate an agreement with a customer, see Torrance National Bank v. Enesco Federal Credit Union, 285 P.2d 737 (Cal.App. 1955). An item drawn for more than the amount of a custome rs account may be properly payable. Thus under subsection (a) a bank may charge the customers account for an item even though payment results in an overdraft. An item containing a forged drawers signature or forged indorsement is not proper ly payable. Concern has arisen whether a bank may require a customer to execute a stop-payment order when the customer notifies the bank of the loss of an unindorsed or specially indorsed check. Since such a check cannot be properly payable from the cus tomers account, it is inappropriate for a bank to require stop-payment order in such a case. 2. Subsection (b) adopts the view of case authority holding that if there is more than one customer who can draw on an account, the nonsigning customer is not li able for an overdraft unless that person benefits from the proceeds of the item. 3. Subsection (c) is added because the automated check collection system cannot accommodate postdated checks. A check is usually paid upon presentment without r espect to the date of the check. Under the former law, if a payor bank paid a postdated check before its stated date, it could not charge the customers account because the check was not properly payable. Hence, the bank might have been liabl e for wrongfully dishonoring subsequent checks of the drawer that would have been paid had the postdated check not been prematurely paid. Under subsection (c) a customer wishing to postdate a check must notify the payor bank of its postdating in time to allow the bank to act on the customers notice before the bank has to commit itself to pay the check. If the bank fails to act on the customers timely notice, it may be liable for damages for the resulting loss which may include damages for disho nor of subsequent items. This Act does not regulate fees that banks charge their customers for a notice of postdating or other services covered by the Act, but under principles of law such as unconscionability or good faith and fair dealing, courts have reviewed fees and the banks exercise of a discretion to set fees. Perdue v. Crocker National Bank, 38 Cal.3d 913 (1985) (unconscionability); Best v. United Bank of Oregon, 739 P.2d 554, 562-566 (1987) (good faith and fair dealing). In addition, Sec tion 1-203 provides that every contract or duty within this Act imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement. 4. Section 3-407(c) states that a payor bank or drawee which pays a fraudulently altered instrument in good faith and without notice of the alteration may enforc e rights with respect to the instrument according to its original terms or, in the case of an incomplete instrument altered by unauthorized completion, according to its terms as completed. Section 4-401(d) follows the rule stated in Section 3-407(c) by a pplying it to an altered item and allows the bank to enforce rights with respect to the altered item by charging the customers account. VIRGINIA COMMENT The UCC follows prior law in allowing a bank to charge a customers account according to the original tenor of an altered item. Natl Bank of Virginia v. No lting, 94 Va. 263, 267, 26S.E. 826 (1897), held that a bank could not charge the drawers account for payment of a $500 check, which had been raised from $10, but no particular point was made as to whether the bank could charge the account for $10, th e original tenor.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-402"><akn:num>§ 8.4-402</akn:num><akn:heading>Banks liability to customer for wrongful dishonor; time of determining insufficiency of account</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) Except as otherwise provided in this title, a payor bank wrongfully dishonors an item if it dishonors an item that is properly payable, but a bank may dishonor an item that would create an overdraft unless it has agreed to pay the overdraft. (b) A payor ba nk is liable to its customer for damages proximately caused by the wrongful dishonor of an item. Liability is limited to actual damages proved and may include damages for an arrest or prosecution of the customer or other consequential damages. Whether a ny consequential damages are proximately caused by the wrongful dishonor is a question of fact to be determined in each case. (c) A payor ba nks determination of the customers account balance on which a decision to dishonor for insufficiency of available funds is based may be made at any time between the time the item is received by the payor bank and the time that the payor bank retu rns the item or gives notice in lieu of return, and no more than one determination need be made. If, at the election of the payor bank, a subsequent balance determination is made for the purpose of reevaluating the banks decision to dishonor the ite m, the account balance at the time is determinative of whether a dishonor for insufficiency of available funds is wrongful.

CASE NOTES Requirement of good faith by person receiving credit.  Title 8.4 neither specifically addresses nor excludes recovery by a bank after final payment when the person receiving the credit acted in bad faith. But to read the requirement of good faith out of Title 8.4 would run contrary to established law that existed prior to the Code as well as contrary to its manifest objectives. Bartlett v. Bank of Carroll, 218 Va. 240, 237 S.E.2d 115, 1977 Va. LEXIS 185 (1977). If the general provisions of the Code are applied, bad faith, if established, would vitiate plaintiffs claim. If not, then the court can resort to supplementa ry principles of law and equity for this result under § 8.1-103 [see now 8.1A-304]. Bartlett v. Bank of Carroll, 218 Va. 240, 237 S.E.2d 115, 1977 Va. LEXIS 185 (1977). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Subsection (a) states positively what has been assumed under the original Article: that if a bank fails to honor a properly payable item it may be liable to its customer for wrongful dishonor. Under subsection (b) the payor banks wrongful dishonor of an item gives rise to a statutory cause of action. Damages may include consequential damages. Confusion has resulted from the attempts of courts to reconci le the first and second sentences of former Section 4-402. The second sentence implied that the bank was liable for some form of damages other than those proximately caused by the dishonor if the dishonor was other than by mistake. But nothing in the se ction described what these noncompensatory damages might be. Some courts have held that in distinguishing between mistaken dishonors and nonmistaken dishonors, the so-called trader rule has been retained that allowed a merchant or trader to recover substantial damages for wrongful dishonor without proof of damages actually suffered. Comment 3 to former Section 4-402 indicated that this was not the intent of the drafters. White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code, Section 18-4 (1988), st ates: The negative implication is that when wrongful dishonors occur not through mistake but willfully, the court may impose damages greater than actual damages . . . . Certainly the reference to mistake in the second sentenc e of 4-402 invites a court to adopt the relevant pre-Code distinction. Subsection (b) by deleting the reference to mistake in the second sentence precludes any inference that Section 4-402 retains the trader rule. Whether a bank is liable fo r noncompensatory damages, such as punitive damages, must be decided by Section 1-103 and Section 1-106 (by other rule of law). 2. Wrongful dishonor is different from failure to exercise ordinary care in handling an item, and the measure of damages is that stated in this section, not that stated in Section 4-103(e). By the same token, if a dishonor comes within this section, the measure of damages of this section applies and not another measure of damages. If the wrongful refusal of the beneficiarys bank to make funds avail able from a funds transfer causes the beneficiarys check to be dishonored, no specific guidance is given as to whether recovery is under this section or Article 4A. In each case this issue must be viewed in its factual context, and it was thought un wise to seek to establish certainty at the cost of fairness. 3. The second and third sentences of the subsection (b) reject decisions holding that as a matter of law the dishonor of a check is not the proximate cause  of the arrest and prosecution of the customer and leave to determination in each case as a question of fact whether the dishonor is or may be the proximate cause. 4. Banks commonly determine whether there are sufficient funds in an account to pay an item after the close of banking hours on the day of presentment when they post debit and credit items to the account. The determination is made on the basis of credits available for withdrawal as of right or made available for withdrawal by the bank as an accommodation to its customer. When it is determined that payment of t he item would overdraw the account, the item may be returned at any time before the banks midnight deadline the following day. Before the item is returned new credits that are withdrawable as of right may have been added to the account. Subsection ( c) eliminates uncertainty under Article 4 as to whether the failure to make a second determination before the item is returned on the day following presentment is a wrongful dishonor if new credits were added to the account on that day that would have co vered the amount of the check. 5. Section 4-402 has been construed to preclude an action for wrongful dishonor by a plaintiff other than the banks customer. Loucks v. Albuquerque National Bank, 418 P.2d 191 (N.Mex. 1966). Some courts have allowed a plaintiff other than the customer to sue when the customer is a business entity that is one and the same with the individual or individuals operating it. Murdaugh Volkswagen, Inc. v. First Na tional Bank, 801 F.2d 719 (4th Cir. 1986) and Karsh v. American City Bank, 113 Cal.App.3d 419, 169 Cal.Rptr. 851 (1980). However, where the wrongful dishonor impugns the reputation of an operator of the business, the issue is not merely, as the court in Koger v. East First National Bank, 443 So.2d 141 (Fla.App. 1983), put it, one of a literal versus a liberal interpretation of Section 4-402. Rather the issue is whether the statutory cause of action in Section 4-402 displaces, in accordance with Sectio n 1-103, any cause of action that existed at common law in a person who is not the customer whose reputation was damaged. See Marcum v. Security Trust and Savings Co., 221 Ala. 419, 129 So. 74 (1930). While Section 4-402 should not be interpreted to di splace the latter cause of action, the section itself gives no cause of action to other than a customer, however that definition is construed, and thus confers no cause of action on the holder of a dishonored item. First American National Bank v . Commerce Union Bank, 692 S.W.2d 642 (Tenn.App. 1985). VIRGINIA COMMENT Although worded differently, the UCC is in accord with Code 1950, § 6-71, repealed by the act enacting the UCC, regulating a banks liability to a customer for wrongful dishonor. The Virginia statute limited the liability of a bank for nonmalicious refusal to pay a check of a depositor to proven actual damages, without specifying what actual damages are. The UCC similarly limits liability to actual damages, but does indicate that damages for an arrest or prosecution are cognizable as consequential actual damages. See also Wood v. American Natl Bank, 100 Va. 306, 40 S.E. 931 (1902), holding that exemplary damages may be awarded where a dishonor is wilful and malicious, or the negligence so gross as to evince a culpable indifference to consequences, but only compensatory damages are authorized where no evil motive is proved.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-403"><akn:num>§ 8.4-403</akn:num><akn:heading>Customers right to stop payment; burden of proof of loss</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) A customer or any person authorized to draw on the account if there is more than one person may stop payment of any item drawn on the customers account or close the account by an order to the bank describing the item or account with reasonable certainty receiv ed at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before any action by the bank with respect to the item described in § 8.4-303. If the signature of more than one person is required to draw on an account, any of these persons may stop payment or close the account. (b) A stop-pay ment order is effective for six months, but it lapses after fourteen calendar days if the original order was oral and was not confirmed in writing within that period. A stop-payment order may be renewed for additional six-month periods by a writing give n to the bank within a period during which the stop-payment order is effective. (c) The burden of establishing the fact and amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order or order to close an account is on the customer. The loss from payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order may include damages fo r dishonor of subsequent items under § 8.4-402. History History.

CASE NOTES Customer held not required to indemnify savings and loan for loss.  A savings and loan association, which ordered that payment be stopped on a check issued on its bank account at the request of a customer of the savings and loan a nd then had a second check issued to replace it when it was reported to have been lost, was held liable for the amount of the first check where the funds represented by it had been withdrawn from the bank in which it had been deposited. The owners of the savings and loan account against which the first check was debited were not required to indemnify the savings and loan for the amount recovered from the savings and loan by the bank, since, except for the original withdrawal from the savings and loan, t he entire transaction was under the control of the savings and loan. Moreover, the owners of the account were never asked to execute a second withdrawal application prior to issuance of the replacement check; thus the savings and loan failed to seek or r eceive authorization to debit their account a second time. The savings and loan, not the customer, set in motion and orchestrated the series of events resulting in double payment and thus the savings and loan should have suffered the loss. Galax Sav. &amp; L oan Ass'n v. Goad, 226 Va. 403, 309 S.E.2d 312, 1983 Va. LEXIS 297 (1983). Stop payment order.  Former husbands letter to a bank, instructing it to freeze my loan from further advances, satisfied the requirements for a stop payment order because the bank replied the same day and was able to identify the type of payment to be stopped, and the banks immediate response demonstrated that the former husband delivered his order in a manner that afforded the bank a reasonable opportunity to act. Ru snack v. Cardinal Bank, N.A., 695 Fed. Appx. 704, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 13409 (4th Cir. 2017). Notice provided.  Former husband satisfied the one-year discover and report requirement because the former husband called the bank soon after he discovered the former wife s first $ 10,000 withdrawal from the account upon which the former husband had placed a stop payment order. Rusnack v. Cardinal Bank, N.A., 695 Fed. Appx. 704, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 13409 (4th Cir. 2017). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. The position taken by this section is that stopping payment or closing an account is a service which depositors expect and are entitled to receive from banks notwithstanding its difficulty, inconvenience and expense. The inevitable occasional losses through failure to stop or close should be borne by the banks as a cost of the business of banking. 2. Subsection (a) follows the decisions holding that a payee or indorsee has no right to stop payment. This is consistent with the provision governing payment o r satisfaction. See Section 3-602. The sole exception to this rule is found in Section 4-405 on payment after notice of death, by which any person claiming an interest in the account can stop payment. 3. Payment is commonly stopped only on checks; but the right to stop payment is not limited to checks, and extends to any item payable by any bank. If the maker of a note payable at a bank is in a position analogous to that of a drawer (Section 4-106) the maker may stop payment of the note. By analogy the rule extends to drawees other than banks. 4. A cashiers check or tellers check purchased by a customer whose account is debited in payment for the check is not a check drawn on the customers account within the meaning of subsection (a); hence, a customer purchasing a cashiers check or tellers check has no right to stop payment of such a check under subsection (a). If a bank issuing a cashiers check or tellers check refuses t o pay the check as an accommodation to its customer or for other reasons, its liability on the check is governed by Section 3-411. There is no right to stop payment after certification of a check or other acceptance of a draft, and this is true no matte r who procures the certification. See Sections 3-411 and 4-303. The acceptance is the drawees own engagement to pay, and it is not required to impair its credit by refusing payment for the convenience of the drawer. 5. Subsection (a) makes clear that if there is more than one person authorized to draw on a customers account any one of them can stop payment of any check d rawn on the account or can order the account closed. Moreover, if there is a customer, such as a corporation, that requires its checks to bear the signatures of more than one person, any of these persons may stop payment on a check. In describing the i tem, the customer, in the absence of a contrary agreement, must meet the standard of what information allows the bank under the technology then existing to identify the item with reasonable certainty. 6. Under subsection (b), a stop-payment order is effective after the order, whether written or oral, is received by the bank and the bank has a reasonable opport unity to act on it. If the order is written it remains in effect for six months from that time. If the order is oral it lapses after 14 days unless there is written confirmation. If there is written confirmation within the 14-day period, the six-month period dates from the giving of the oral order. A stop-payment order may be renewed any number of times by written notice given during a six-month period while a stop order is in effect. A new stop-payment order may be given after a six-month period expi res, but such a notice takes effect from the date given. When a stop-payment order expires it is as though the order had never been given, and the payor bank may pay the item in good faith under Section 4-404 even though a stop-payment order had once bee n given. 7. A payment in violation of an effective direction to stop payment is an improper payment, even though it is made by mistake or inadvertence. Any agreement to the contrary is invalid under Section 4-103(a) if in paying the item over the stop-payment order the bank has failed to exercise ordinary care. An agreement to the contrary which is imposed upon a customer as part of a standard form contract would have to be evaluated in the light of the general obligation of good faith. Sections 1-203 and 4-104(c). The drawee is, however, entitled to subrogation to prevent unjust enrichment (Section 4-407); retains common law defenses, e.g., that by conduct in recog nizing the payment the customer has ratified the banks action in paying over a stop-payment order (Section 1-103); and retains common law rights, e.g., to recover money paid under a mistake under Section 3-418. It has sometimes been said that paymen t cannot be stopped against a holder in due course, but the statement is inaccurate. The payment can be stopped but the drawer remains liable on the instrument to the holder in due course (Sections 3-305, 3-414) and the drawee, if it pays, becomes subro gated to the rights of the holder in due course against the drawer. Section 4-407. The relationship between Section 4-403 and 4-407 is discussed in the Comments to Section 4-407. Any defenses available against a holder in due course remain available t o the drawer, but other defenses are cut off to the same extent as if the holder were bringing the action. VIRGINIA COMMENT The UCC recognizes the right of a customer to stop payment on any item payable from his account, if the order is received by the bank at such time and in such man ner as to afford the bank a reasonable opportunity to act upon it. Oral orders are binding only for fourteen calendar days, unless confirmed in writing within that period. Written orders are effective only for six months, unless renewed in writing. The p urposes of the UCC are the same, although the details differ, as those of the prior Virginia statute, which provides that a stop-payment, initially, shall not be valid for more than one year, but that further renewals, to be effective for not more than o ne year each, may be made. The prior Virginia statute requires the renewal to be in writing, but it does not impose this requirement for the original stop-payment order.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-404"><akn:num>§ 8.4-404</akn:num><akn:heading>Bank not obligated to pay check more than six months old</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A bank is under no obligation to a customer having a checking account to pay a check, other than a certified check, which is presented more than six months after its da te, but it may charge its customers account for a payment made thereafter in good faith. History History. Code 1950, § 6-72; 1964, c. 219. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3A M.J. Banks and Banking, § 52. OFFICIAL COMMENT This section incorporates a type of statute adopted in twenty-six jurisdictions. The time limit is set at six months because banking and commercial practice regar ds a check outstanding for longer than that period as stale, and a bank will normally not pay such a check without consulting the depositor. It is therefore not required to do so, but is given the option to pay because it may be in a position to know, as in the case of dividend checks, that the drawer wants payment made. Certified checks are excluded from the section because they are the primary obligation of the certifying bank (Sections 3-411 and 3-413), which obligation runs di rect to the holder of the check. The customers account was charged when the check was certified. VIRGINIA COMMENT The UCC provides that a bank is under no obligation to pay a stale check presented more than six months after its date. The prior Virginia statute provides that a bank is under no obligation to pay a demand check presented more than one year from its date of issue. Besides being more favorable to the banks, and more exact, the UCC also authorizes the bank to charge its customers account for good faith payments made after it is no longer obligated to make them.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-405"><akn:num>§ 8.4-405</akn:num><akn:heading>Death or incompetence of customer</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) A payor or collecting banks authority to accept, pay or collect an item or to account for proceeds of its collection if otherwise effective is not rendered ineffective by the incapacity of a customer of either bank existing at the time the item is issued or it s collection is undertaken if the bank does not know of an adjudication of incapacity. Neither death nor incapacity of a customer revokes the authority to accept, pay, collect or account until the bank knows of the fact of death or of an adjudication of incapacity and has reasonable opportunity to act on it. (b) Even with knowledge a bank may for ten days after the date of death pay or certify checks drawn on or before that date unless ordered to stop payment by a person claiming an interest in the account.

Sturgill v. Virginia Citizens Bank, 223 Va. 394, 291 S.E.2d 207, 1982 Va. LEXIS 218 (1982). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Subsection (a) follows existing decisions holding that a drawee (payor) bank is not liable for the payment of a check before it has notice of the death or inc ompetence of the drawer. The justice and necessity of the rule are obvious. A check is an order to pay which the bank must obey under penalty of possible liability for dishonor. Further, with the tremendous volume of items handled any rule that require d banks to verify the continued life and competency of drawers would be completely unworkable. One or both of these same reasons apply to other phases of the bank collection and payment process and the rule is made wide enough to apply to these other phases . It applies to all kinds of items; to customers who own items as well as customers who draw or make them; to the function of collecting items as well as the function of accepting or paying them; to the carrying out of instructio ns to account for proceeds even though these may involve transfers to third parties; to depositary and intermediary banks as well as payor banks; and to incompetency existing at the time of the issuance of an item or the commencement of the collection or payment process as well as to incompetency occurring thereafter. Further, the requirement of actual knowledge makes inapplicable the rule of some cases that an adjudication of incompetency is constructive notice to all the world because obviously it is as impossible for banks to keep posted on such adjudications (in the absence of actual knowledge) as it is to keep posted as to death of immediate or remote customers. 2. Subsection (b) provides a limited period after death during which a bank may continue to pay checks (as distinguished from other items) even though it has not ice. The purpose of the provision, as of the existing statutes, is to permit holders of checks drawn and issued shortly before death to cash them without the necessity of filing a claim in probate. The justification is that these checks normally are giv en in immediate payment of an obligation, that there is almost never any reason why they should not be paid, and that filing in probate is a useless formality, burdensome to the holder, the executor, the court and the bank. This section does not prevent an executor or administrator from recovering the payment from the holder of the check. It is not intended to affect the validity of any gift causa mortis or other transfer in contemplation of death, but merely to relieve the bank of liability for the payment. 3. Any surviving relative, creditor or other person who claims an interest in the account may give a direction to the bank not to pay checks, or not to pay a par ticular check. Such notice has the same effect as a direction to stop payment. The bank has no responsibility to determine the validity of the claim or even whether it is colorable. But obviously anyone who has an interest in the estate, includin g the person named as executor in a will, even if the will has not yet been admitted to probate, is entitled to claim an interest in the account. VIRGINIA COMMENT Under the UCC, until a bank has knowledge of the death or an adjudication of incompetency of a customer and a reasonable opportunity to act on it, the authority o f the bank to accept, pay, or collect his items is not revoked. Even with knowledge of death the bank for ten days after the date of death may pay or certify checks drawn on or prior to the date of death, although it is not intended to prevent the person al representative from recovering the payment. A person claiming an interest in the account may, however, order the bank to stop payment. Virginia, by an amendment to the NIL, provides in Code 1950, § 6-540, repealed by the act enacting the UCC, that the authority of a bank to pay checks is not revoked for a period of two weeks, but it is not clear whether the two-week period runs from the date of death of the drawer or from the date the bank has knowledge of the death of the drawer.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.4-406"><akn:num>§ 8.4-406</akn:num><akn:heading>Customers duty to discover and report unauthorized signature or alteration</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) A bank tha t sends or makes available to a customer a statement of account showing payment of items for the account shall either return or make available to the customer the items paid or provide information in the statement of account sufficient to allow the custo mer reasonably to identify the items paid. The statement of account provides sufficient information if the item is described by item number, amount, and date of payment. (b) If the ite ms are not returned to the customer, the person retaining the items shall either retain the items or, if the items are destroyed, maintain the capacity to furnish legible copies of the items until the expiration of seven years after receipt of the items. A customer may request an item from the bank that paid the item, and the bank must provide in a reasonable time either the item or, if the item has been destroyed or is not otherwise obtainable, a legible copy of the item. (c) If a bank sends or makes available a statement of account or items pursuant to subsection (a), the customer must exercise reasonable promptness in examining the statement or the items to determine whether any payment was not authorized because of an alteration of an item or because a purported signature by or on behalf of the customer was not authorized. If, based on the statement or items provided, the customer should reasonably have discovered the unauthorized payment, the customer must promptly notify the ban k of the relevant facts. (d) If the ban k proves that the customer failed with respect to an item to comply with the duties imposed on the customer by subsection (c) the customer is precluded from asserting against the bank: (1) the customers unauthorized signature or any alteration on the item, if the bank also proves that it suffered a loss by reason of the failure; and (2) the customers unauthorized signature or alteration by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in good faith by the bank if the payment was made before the bank received notice from the customer of the unauthorized signature or alteration and after the customer had been afforded a reasonable period of time, not exceeding thirty days, in which to examine the item or statement of account and notify the bank. (e) If subsect ion (d) applies and the customer proves that the bank failed to exercise ordinary care in paying the item and that the failure substantially contributed to loss, the loss is allocated between the customer precluded and the bank asserting the preclusion a ccording to the extent to which the failure of the customer to comply with subsection (c) and the failure of the bank to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss. If the customer proves that the bank did not pay an item in good faith, the preclusi on under subsection (d) does not apply. (f) Without re gard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank, a customer who does not within one year after the statement or items are made available to the customer (subsection (a)) discover and report the customers unauthorized signature on or a ny alteration on the item is precluded from asserting against the bank the unauthorized signature or alteration. If there is a preclusion under this subsection, the payor bank may not recover for breach of warranty under § 8.4-207.2 with respect to t he unauthorized signature or alteration to which the preclusion applies.

Subsection (f) of this section is devoid of any language which limits the customers duty to discover and report unauthorized signatures and alterations to ite ms paid in good faith by the bank; the absence of the phrase good faith in the language chosen by the General Assembly compels the conclusion that a banks statutory right to assert a customers failure to give the statutorily prescribed no tice is not predicated upon whether the bank exercised good faith in paying the item which contained the unauthorized signature or alteration.

Radin v. Crestar Bank, 249 Va. 440, 457 S.E.2d 65, 1995 Va. LEXIS 57 (1995). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. In order to impose on its customer the duty stated in subsection (c) to examine a statement or the returned items and report unauthorized signatures of the cu stomer or alterations, the bank must comply with subsection (a) in sending or making available to the customer a statement of the account. Whether the bank returns to the customer the items paid is a matter for bank-customer agreement. If the agreement is that the bank does not return the items paid, a general standard is stated that the customer must be given information sufficient to allow the customer reasonably to identify the items paid. If the bank supplies its customer with an image of an item, it complies with this standard. But a safeharbor rule is provided. If the item is described by item number, amount, and date of payment, the bank does comply. This information was chosen because it can be obtained by the banks computer from the checks MICR line without examination of the items involved. The other two items of information that the customer would normally want to know  the name of the payee and the date of the item  cannot currently be obtained from the MICR line. The safeharbor rule is important in determining the feasibility of payor or collecting bank check retention plans. A customer who keeps a record of items written will have sufficient information to identify the item on the basis of item number, amount and date of payment. But customers who dont keep records may not. The policy decision is that accommodating these customers is not as desirable as accommodating others who keep more careful records at less cost to the check collection system and, thus, to all customers of the system. It is expected that technological advances may make it possible for banks to give customers more information in the future in a manner that is fully compatible with automation or truncation systems. At that tim e the Permanent Editorial Board may wish to make recommendation for an amendment revising the safe harbor requirements in the light of those advances. 2. Subsection (b) applies if the items are not returned to the customer. Check retention plans may include a simple payor bank check retention plan or the kind of check retention plan that would be authorized by a truncation agreement in which a collecting bank or the payee may retain the items. Even after agreeing to a check retention plan, a customer may need to see one or more checks for litigation or other purposes. The customers request for the check may always be made to the payor bank.

History History. 1964, c. 219; 1992, c. 693. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Section 4-403 states that a stop-payment order or an order to close an account is binding on a bank. If a bank pays an item over such an order it is prima fa cie liable, but under subsection (c) of Section 4-403 the burden of establishing the fact and amount of loss from such payment is on the customer. A defense frequently interposed by a bank in an action against it for wrongful payment over a stop-payment order is that the drawer or maker suffered no loss because it would have been liable to a holder in due course in any event. On this argument some cases have held that payment cannot be stopped against a holder in due course. Payment can be stopped, bu t if it is, the drawer or maker is liable and the sound rule is that the bank is subrogated to the rights of the holder in due course. The preamble and paragraph (1) of this section state this rule. 2. Paragraph (2) also subrogates the bank to the rights of the payee or other holder against the drawer or maker either on the item or under the transaction out of which it arose. It may well be that the payee is not a holder in due course by still has good rights against the drawer. These may be on the check but also may not be as, for example, where the drawer buys goods from the payee and the goods are parti ally defective so that the payee is not entitled to the full price, but the goods are still worth a portion of the contract price. If the drawer retains the goods it is obligated to pay a part of the agreed price. If the bank has paid the check it shoul d be subrogated to this claim of the payee against the drawer. 3. Paragraph (3) subrogates the bank to the rights of the drawer or maker against the payee or other holder with respect to the transaction out of which the item arose. If, for example, the payee was a fraudulent salesman inducing the drawer to issue a check for defective securities, and the bank pays the check over a stop-payment order but reimburses the drawer for such payment, the bank should have a basis fo r getting the money back from the fraudulent salesman. 4. The limitations of the preamble prevent the bank itself from getting any double recovery or benefits out of its subrogation rights conferred by the section. 5. The spelling out of the affirmative rights of the bank in this section does not destroy other existing rights (Section 1-103). Among others these may include the defense of a payor bank that by conduct in recognizing the payment a customer has ratified the banks action in paying in disregard of a stop-payment order or right to recover money paid under a mistake. VIRGINIA COMMENT The UCC goes somewhat beyond the dictum in McAuley v. Morris Plan Bank, 155 Va. 777, 156 S.E. 418 (1931), to the effect that a payor bank ignoring a stop-payment order would be subrogated as against the drawer to the rights of a holder in due course who had presented the instrument and received payment. In McAuley the precise question was not presented. A depositary bank paid its depositor by a check drawn on ano ther bank. The depositor indorsed the check to a third person and then discovered that the automobile for which the check had been indorsed had been stolen. At the request of the depositor the depositary bank stopped payment on its check. But on learning that another bank had cashed the check in good faith, the bank withdrew the stop-payment order. In an action by the depositor against the depositary bank the court said that the ultimate question in such a case would be whether there was a holder in due course. PART 5.
