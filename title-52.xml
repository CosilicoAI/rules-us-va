Nor does the Matt aponi Indian reservation qualify as Indian country for federal purposes, where there has not been federal recognition of that tribe.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Virginia law-enforcement officers have authority to d etain and arrest individuals who have committed violations of the laws of the United States and other states, and such authority extends to violations of federal criminal immigration law.

Stolle, Member, Senate of Virginia, and The Honorable David B. Albo, Member, House of Delegates, 07-086 (10/15/07). Law-enforcement officers may inquire into immigration status.  Virginia law-enforcement officers, including conservation officers, may inquire into the immigration status of persons stopped or arrested; however, persons taske d with enforcing zoning laws lack the authority to investigate criminal violations of the law, including criminal violations of the immigration laws of the United States.

CASE NOTES This section is not applicable when a city police officer makes an arrest for an offense committed in his presence. It does not require a city police officer to secure the issuance of a warrant against accused. Gooch v. City of Lynchburg, 201 Va. 172, 110 S.E.2d 236, 1959 Va. LEXIS 208 (1959). Section was not applicable where the record showed that the accident occurred in Staffor d County and defendant was taken directly from the scene to a Fredericksburg hospital and arrested at the hospital and upon his release, officer took the accused to a Stafford County magistrate and obtained a warrant since the warrantless arrest at the h ospital following the accident was made pursuant to § 19.2-81. Walter v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 485, 382 S.E.2d 484, 6 Va. Law Rep. 118, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 95 (1989). The mandate to forthwith bring before a judicial officer must be performed with reasonable promptness and without unnecessary delay under the circumstances. Winston v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 386, 49 S.E.2d 611, 1948 Va. LEXIS 173 (1948); McHone v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 435, 57 S.E.2d 109, 1950 Va. LEXIS 142 (1950). Where arresting officer delivered one arrested for a violation of § 18.1-54 (now § 18.2-266) to the jailer at 4:30 p.m., with the injunction that he be held there until 9:00 p.m., at which later time he was to be brought before a judicial officer, the arresting officer did not comply with the mandate of this section to produce the defendant forthwith before a judicial officer. Winston v. Commonwealt h, 188 Va. 386, 49 S.E.2d 611, 1948 Va. LEXIS 173 (1948). Defendant was arrested after midnight and though at 2:00 a.m. and at 6:00 a.m. he indicated to the police at the lockup that he wished to be bailed, and there was a bondsmans office next door and defendant had the money to pay the cost of bail, he was not taken before a justice of the peace until 9:00 a.m. The officers gave no excuse for this failure and their action was illegal. Holt v. City of Richmond, 204 Va. 364, 131 S.E.2d 394, 1963 Va. LEXIS 158 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 917, 84 S. Ct. 672, 11 L. Ed. 2d 613, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 1858 (1964). But a reasonable time and some latitude must be allowed to arresting officers in keeping a prisoner in custody before taking him to a judicial officer. McHone v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 435, 57 S.E.2d 109, 1950 Va. LEXIS 142 (1950). While this section requires the arresting officer to bring the prisoner forthwith before a judicial officer, this does not mean that he must forsake all o ther duties and do so immediately upon making the arrest. Winston v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 386, 49 S.E.2d 611, 1948 Va. LEXIS 173 (1948). And failure to perform duty does not necessarily invalidate conviction.  The mere fact that an arresting officer fails to perform his duty of bringing an arrested person before a judicial officer does not necessarily invalidate his sub sequent conviction. McHone v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 435, 57 S.E.2d 109, 1950 Va. LEXIS 142 (1950). Unless accused was deprived of material evidence.  Where person arrested for a violation of § 18.1-54 (now 18.2-266) was not brought before a judicial officer until nearly five hours after his arrest, he was de prived of material evidence which might have supported his claim that he was innocent of the charge, and his subsequent conviction lacked the required due process of law. Winston v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 386, 49 S.E.2d 611, 1948 Va. LEXIS 173 (1948). But in McHone v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 435, 57 S.E.2d 109 (1950)since it was not shown that officers acts in holding defendant about four hours before taking him before a justice had deprived defendant of material evidence, his conviction was affirmed. The denial of rights did not invalidate defendants subsequent conviction where the jury correctly determined under proper instructions that it did not result in depriving defendant of evidence material to his defense or opportunity to obtain such evidence.

The Departm ent of State Police shall keep and maintain an Applicant Fingerprint Database separate and apart from all other records maintained by the Department. The purpose of the database shall be to allow those agencies and entities who require a criminal backgro und check as a condition of licensure, certification, employment, or volunteer service to be advised when an individual subject to such screening is arrested for, or convicted of, a criminal offense which would disqualify that individual from licensure, certification, employment or volunteer service with that entity. The Department is authorized to submit fingerprints and accompanying records to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to be advised through the FBIs Next Generation Identification R ap Back service when an individual subject to a criminal background check is arrested for, or convicted of, a criminal offense not reported to the Department which would disqualify that individual from licensure, certification, employment, or volunteer s ervice with that entity. B. As used in this section:Participating entity means an agency or organization that requires a fingerprint bac kground check as a condition of licensure, certification, employment, or volunteer service, and that has elected to participate in the database.Individual means any person who has submitted fingerprints to a participating entity in order to be licensed, certified, employed, or to perform volunteer service with that entity. C. The Departm ent of State Police shall notify forthwith the participating entity that employs, certifies, licenses, or accepts the volunteer services of an individual whose prints are maintained in the database upon receipt of a report that the individual has been ar rested for or convicted of an offense that would disqualify that individual from licensure, certification, employment or volunteer service with that entity. The information contained in the notification shall be used by the entity for purposes of determi ning the eligibility of the continued service of the individual and shall not be further disseminated. D. Use of the information contained in the database or received from the database for purposes not authorized by this section is prohibited, and a willful violation of this section with the intent to harass or intimidate another shall be punished as a Class 1 misdemea nor. E. No liabilit y shall be imposed upon any law-enforcement official who disseminates information or fails to disseminate information in good faith compliance with the requirements of this section, but this provision shall not be construed to grant immunity for gross ne gligence or willful misconduct. F. The Departm ent of State Police shall promulgate regulations governing the operation and maintenance of the database and the expungement of records on persons who are deceased, or who are no longer employed, licensed, certified, or in volunteer service for the entit y that submitted the fingerprints. G. The Departm ent of State Police may charge an annual fee not to exceed $10 per individual entered into the database. The fee shall be paid no later than July 15 of each year by the participating entity or entities submitting fingerprints to the database or by the en tity or entities requesting notification regarding an individual. An individual whose licensure, certification, employment, or volunteer service moves from one entity to another need not be reprinted. When more than one participating entity licenses, cer tifies, employs, or accepts the volunteer services of an individual in the database, both entities shall be responsible for paying the full cost for maintenance and notification. Any fees collected shall be deposited in a special account to be used to of fset the costs of enhancing and administering the database. H. The Departm ent of State Police shall make the database available no later than January 1, 2005, unless funds necessary to develop and operate the database are unavailable. I.
