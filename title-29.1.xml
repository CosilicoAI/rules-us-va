CASE NOTES Police officer may arrest person who commits a misdemeanor in his presence.  See Yeatts v. Minton, 211 Va. 402, 177 S.E.2d 646, 1970 Va. LEXIS 260 (1970) (decided under former § 29-32). Even though officer has no arres t warrant.  See Yeatts v. Minton, 211 Va. 402, 177 S.E.2d 646, 1970 Va. LEXIS 260 (1970) (decided under former § 29-32). An arrest, though warrantless, is valid where the officer had probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor was committed in his presence, even though the action h e observed did not in fact constitute a misdemeanor. Yeatts v. Minton, 211 Va. 402, 177 S.E.2d 646, 1970 Va. LEXIS 260 (1970) (decided under former § 29-32). And, in enforcing the game laws, a game warden has the same authority conferred upon a p olice officer to arrest a person who commits a misdemeanor in his presence. Yeatts v. Minton, 211 Va. 402, 177 S.E.2d 646, 1970 Va. LEXIS 260 (1970) (decided under former § 29-32). Probable cause held to exist.  What the game warden saw, when he observed a truck while it was crossing the field, and when he saw a shotgun in the truck, gave him probable cause to believe tha t the driver was committing the misdemeanor of illegal night hunting in the wardens presence. He was therefore authorized to take the driver into custody, at least while investigating the question of good cause for his actions. Yeatts v. Minton, 211 Va. 402, 177 S.E.2d 646, 1970 Va.

CASE NOTES Hunting defined.  Hunting is defined to be the act of pursuing and taking game or wild animals; to pursue for the purpose of killing or catching, as to hunt the lion; to take part in the chase for sport or exercise, as to hunt the fox; to go in pursuit of wild animals for food or feather. Commonwealth v. Bailey, 124 Va. 800, 97 S.E. 774, 1919 Va. LEXIS 166 (1919) (decided under prior law). One who engages in fox hunting in this state was held to be a person who hunts within the meaning of an earlier but substantially similar statute. Commonwealth v. Bailey, 124 Va. 800, 97 S.E. 774, 1919 Va. LEXIS 166 (1919) (decided under prior law). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Inland waters.  An Indian who habitually resides on an Indian reservation or an Indian that is a member of a Virginia recognized tribe who resides in the Commonwealth is not req uired to obtain a license to fish in Virginias inland waters, or to hunt or trap in Virginia. Members of the Virginia tribes that were parties to the Treaty of 1677 with England are not required to obtain a license to fish or oyster in Virginias tidal waters provided the activity is limited to harvesting for sustenance. Virginia Indians are bound by the trapping, hunting and fishing laws and regulations of the Commonwealth regardless of whether they are on or off a reservation.

Travelstead, Commissioner, Virginia Marine Resources Commission, 12-044, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 59 (7/19/13). Tags are nontransferable.  A Virginia hunter with a valid hunting license from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries cannot transfer his hunting tags to another Virginia-lice nsed hunter to be used to harvest animals on behalf of the transferor.

For related discussion, see 9A M.J. Game and Game Laws, §§ 1, 2, 5. CASE NOTES Section provides two related presumptions.  This section first provides a presumption that any person is guilty of a violation who at night in possession of a specified type of weapon flashes a light from a vehicle without good cause. It then provides a second presumption that every person in or on such vehicle is a principal in the second degree. Thus, the second presumption incorporates the first. Only a person in or on a vehicle meeting the requ irements of the first presumption is deemed to be a principal in the second degree under the second presumption. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 33, 301 S.E.2d 1, 1983 Va. LEXIS 189 (1983) (decided under prior law). If the first presumption is invalid, the second necessarily falls; if the first is valid , the second may not necessarily survive. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 33, 301 S.E.2d 1, 1983 Va. LEXIS 189 (1983) (decided under prior law). Second presumption, if employed by the jury, operates only in a permissive or burden-of-production-shifting manner. Such a presumption is not unconstitutional if there was a rational connection between the proved and presumed facts. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 33, 301 S.E.2d 1, 1983 Va. LEXIS 189 (1983) (decided under prior law). The presumption of guilt under this section is rebuttable and is to be analyzed as a per missive inference, even if it is construed to require the defendants to produce some evidence of good cause. The defendants, therefore, under this analysis, have no standing to make a facial attack on the constitutionality of the presumption by a rguing that it would be unconstitutional if applied to others in hypothetical cases. Rather, they may challenge their conviction only on the basis that there was not a rational connection between the facts proved in their case and the presumption that wa s raised or that the latter did not flow more likely than not from the former. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 33, 301 S.E.2d 1, 1983 Va. LEXIS 189 (1983) (decided under prior law). Presumption held constitut ionally applied.  The presumption that a person or persons in the car violated the statute was not unconstitutional where, in addition to the facts required to raise the presumptio n under the statute, there was evidence that there was in the car a loaded rifle accessible to the occupants, that the car twice turned into areas frequented by deer, that the headlights of the car twice shone on deer, and that one of the defendants beca me abusive when confronted by the game warden.

Whenever de er, elk or bear are damaging fruit trees, crops, livestock or personal property utilized for commercial agricultural production in the Commonwealth, the owner or lessee of the lands on which such damage is done shall immediately report the damage to the Director or his designee for investigation. If after investigation the Director or his designee finds that deer or bear are responsible for the damage, he shall authorize in writing the owner, lessee or any other person designated by the Director or his designee to kill such deer or bear when they are found upon the land upon which the damages occurred. However, the Director or his designee shall have the option of authorizing nonlethal control measures rather than authorizing the killing of elk or bear , provided that such measures occur within a reasonable period of time; and whenever deer cause damage on parcels of land of five acres or less, except when such acreage is used for commercial agricultural production, the Director or his designee shall h ave discretion as to whether to issue a written authorization to kill the deer. The Director or his designee may limit such authorization by specifying in writing the number of animals to be killed and duration for which the authorization is effective an d may in proximity to residential areas and under other appropriate circumstances limit or prohibit the authorization between 11:00 p.m. and one-half hour before sunrise of the following day. The Director or his designees issuing these authorizations sha ll specify in writing that only antlerless deer shall be killed, unless the Director or his designee determines that there is clear and convincing evidence that the damage was done by deer with antlers. Any owner or lessee of land who has been issued a w ritten authorization shall not be issued an authorization in subsequent years unless he can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director or his designee that during the period following the prior authorization, the owner or his designee has hunted bea r or deer on the land for which he received a previous authorization. B. Subject to the provisions of subsection A, the Director or his designee may issue a written authorization to kill deer causing damage to residential plants, whether ornamental, noncommercial agricultural, or other types of residential plants. The Director may charg e a fee not to exceed actual costs. The holder of this written authorization shall be subject to local ordinances, including those regulating the discharge of firearms. C. Whenever wi ldlife is creating a hazard to the operation of any aircraft or to the facilities connected with the operation of aircraft, the person or persons responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft or facilities shall report such fact to the Director or h is designee for investigation. If after investigation the Director or his designee finds that wildlife is creating a hazard, he shall authorize such person or persons or their representatives to kill wildlife when the wildlife is found to be creating suc h a hazard. As used in this subsection, the term wildlife shall not include any federally protected species. D. Whenever de er are creating a hazard to the operation of motor vehicle traffic within the corporate limits of any city or town, the operator of a motor vehicle or chief law-enforcement officer of the city or town may report such fact to the Director or his designee for investigation. If after investigation the Director or his designee finds that deer are creating a hazard within such city or town, he may authorize responsible persons, or their representatives, to kill the deer when they are found to be creating suc h a hazard. E. Whenever de er are damaging property in a locality in which deer herd population reduction has been recommended in the current Deer Management Plan adopted by the Board, the owner or lessee of the lands on which such damage is being done may report such damage to th e Director or his designee for investigation. If after investigation the Director or his designee finds that deer are responsible for the damage, he may authorize in writing the owner, lessee or any other person designated by the Director or his designee to kill such deer when they are found upon the land upon which the damages occurred. The Director or his designee also may limit such authorization by specifying in writing the number of animals to be killed and the period of time for which the authoriz ation is effective. The requirement in subsection A of this section, that an owner or lessee of land demonstrate that during the period following the prior authorization deer or bear have been hunted on his land, shall not apply to any locality that cond ucts a deer population control program authorized by the Department. F. The Directo r or his designee may revoke or refuse to reissue any authorization granted under this section when it has been shown by a preponderance of the evidence that an abuse of the authorization has occurred. Such evidence may include a complaint filed by any p erson with the Department alleging that an abuse of the written authorization has occurred. Any person aggrieved by the issuance, denial or revocation of a written authorization can appeal the decision to the Department. Any person convicted of violating any provision of the hunting and trapping laws and regulations shall be entitled to receive written authorization to kill deer or bear. However, such person shall not (i) be designated as a shooter nor (ii) carry out the authorized activity for a person who has received such written authorization for a period of at least two years and up to five years following his most recent conviction for violating any provision of the hunting and trapping laws and regulations. In determining the appropriate length of this restriction, the Director shall take into account the nature and severity of the most recent violation and of any past violations of the hunting and trapping laws and regulations by the applicant. No person shall be designated as a shooter under this section during a period when such persons hunting license or privileges to hunt have been suspended or revoked. G. The Directo r or his designee may authorize, subject to the provisions of this section, the killing of deer over bait within the political boundaries of any city or town, or any county with a special late antlerless season, in the Commonwealth when requested by a ce rtified letter from the governing body of such locality. H. The parts o f any deer or bear killed pursuant to this section or wildlife killed pursuant to subsection C shall not be used for the purposes of taxidermy, mounts, or any public display unless authorized by the Director or his designee.

CASE NOTES Word knowingly is equivalent to the word willfully.  The term knowingly imports a knowledge that the facts exist which constitute the act or omission of a crime, and does not require knowledge of the unlawfu lness of the act or omission. Good v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 996, 154 S.E. 477, 1930 Va. LEXIS 186 (1930) (decided under prior law). This section and the State Water Control Law must be read together, and the provisions o f this section must be given effect so far as may be done without denying effect to the clear provisions of the latter law contained in § 62.1-44.2 et seq. American Cyanamid Co. v. Commonwealth, 187 Va. 831, 48 S.E.2d 279, 1948 Va. LEXIS 272 (1948) ( decided under prior law). This section has been supplanted to some extent by the State Water Control Law, as appli ed to pollution by industrial waste. When the Water Control Board, under the provisions of Chapter 3.1 (§ 62.1-44.2 et seq.) of Title 62.1, has assumed jurisdiction in a particular case by issuing a certificate to continue to discharge industrial wast e, the discharge of such waste can no longer be made the basis of a prosecution for violation of this section. Until such a certificate has been issued, however, this section remains in full force and effect. American Cyanamid Co. v. Commonwealth, 187 V a. 831, 48 S.E.2d 279, 1948 Va. LEXIS 272 (1948) (decided under prior law). Use of waterco urses in public interest not involved.  This section is a criminal statute and a prosecution under it involves only the question of guilt or innocence, without any regard to reasonable and necessary use of watercourses in the public interest. American Cyanamid Co. v. Commonwealth, 187 Va. 831, 48 S.E.2d 279, 1948 Va. LEXIS 272 (1948) (decided under prior law).
