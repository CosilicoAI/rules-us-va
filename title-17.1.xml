By December 1 of each year, the Supreme Court, or it s designee, shall transmit a report of the evaluation in the final year of the term of each justice and judge whose term expires during the next session of the General Assembly to the Chairmen of the House Committee for Courts of Justice and the Senate C ommittee on the Judiciary. Such report shall include the number of cases during the judges term in which a judge imposed a sentence that is either greater or less than that indicated by the sentencing guidelines and did not file a written explanation of such departure required pursuant to subsection B of § 19.2-298.01. The Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission shall provide such information to the Supreme Court by November 1. B. The reporti ng requirement of this section shall become effective when funds are appropriated for this program and shall apply to the evaluation of any justice or judge who has had at least one interim evaluation conducted during his term.

Such interim evaluation shall be commenced by the judicial performance evaluation program no later than the mid point of his term. C. All records created or maintained by or on behalf of the judicial performance evaluation program related to an evaluation of any individual justice or judge are confidential and shall not be disclosed, except that any report provided to the General Assembly pursuan t to this section shall be a public record that is open to inspection.

If a judge of any court of record is absent, sick or disabled or for any other reason unable to hold any regular or special term of the court, or any part thereof, or to perform or discharge any official duty or function authorized or required by law, a judge or re tired judge of any court of record may be obtained by personal request of the disabled judge, or another judge of the circuit to hold the court for the whole or any part of such regular or special term and to discharge during vacation such duty or functi on, or, if the circumstances require, to perform all the duties and exercise all the powers and jurisdiction as judges of such circuit until the judge is again able to attend his duties. The designation of such judge shall be entered in the civil order b ook of the court, and a copy thereof sent to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice shall be notified forthwith at the time any disabled judge is able to return to his duties. B. If all the judges of any court of record are so situated in respect to any case, civil or criminal, pending in their court as to render it improper, in their opinion, for them to preside at the trial, unless the cause or proceeding is removed, as provided by law, t hey shall enter the fact of record and the clerk of the court shall at once certify the same to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who shall designate a judge of some other court of record or a retired judge of any such court to preside at the trial of such case. C. If a vacanc y occurs in the office of a judge of a court of record that fact shall be immediately certified by the clerk of such court to the Governor, who may, instead of appointing a successor at once, request the Chief Justice to designate a judge of some other c ourt of record or a retired judge of any such court to carry out the duties of the office, if there are insufficient judges in the circuit to carry out the work of the court, until the office has been filled in the mode prescribed by law. If any judge so designated shall be prevented by the duties of his court, or by sickness, from performing the duties required, he shall so inform the Chief Justice, who may designate another judge in his place. D. Due to cong estion in the work of any court of record or when in his opinion the administration of justice so requires, the Chief Justice may, upon his own initiative or upon application of the judge desiring assistance, designate a judge or retired judge of any cou rt of record to assist the judge in the performance of his duties and every judge so designated shall have the same powers and jurisdiction and be authorized to perform the same duties as the judge whom he is designated to assist. E. Any judge o r retired judge sitting under any provision of this section or sitting by designation on any three-judge court shall receive from the state treasury actual expenses for the time he is actually engaged in holding court, except in those cases where the pay ment of such expenses is otherwise specifically provided by law. F. The powers and duties herein conferred and imposed upon the Chief Justice may be exercised and performed by any justice, or any committee of justices, of the Court, designated by the Chief Justice for such purpose. G. If the chie f judge of any circuit is unable to perform the duties required by law, he shall notify the Chief Justice, who shall designate another judge of the same circuit to perform such duties. H. If any judg e refuses unreasonably to serve as requested under the provisions of this section, the chief judge may report his refusal to the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission. I.

This section allows any trial judge in Virginia to preside over the court of any other judge in the State upon the mere request or procurement of the latter, without any designation by the Governor [now Chief Justice]. Bukva v. Matthews, 149 Va. 500, 140 S.E. 674, 1927 Va. LEXIS 191 (1927). Substitute judge has full power.  A judge designated by the Governor [now Chief Justice] to hold the court of another judge, who has been rendered permanently unable to act, is clothed with every function that pertained to the judge of the court, and is competent to pass upon every case then remaining upon the docket, including a motion to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is contrary to the evidence, so that his decision may be reviewed by the appellate court although he never heard the witnesses testify, and the verdict was rendered before his designation. Southall v. Evans, 114 Va. 461, 76 S.E. 929, 1913 Va. LEXIS 108 (1913) (see also Conway v. Commonwealth, 118 Va. 792, 88 S.E. 75 (1 916)). Regular judge need enter nothing on record unless disqualified.  This section clearly provides that only in the event of one contingency is it necessary for the regular judge to enter anything on the record, i.e., when, in his opinion, he is disqualified. Akers v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1046, 156 S.E. 763, 1931 Va. LEXIS 280 (1931) (see Gresham v. Ewell, 85 Va. 1, 6 S.E. 700 (1888)). And in any event no order is required.  This section, covering every contingency which might prevent a judge from holding his own court, requires no order in any event. A mere statement of fact is requi red to be entered when the resident judge is disqualified, and that fact certified to the Governor (now Chief Justice). Akers v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1046, 156 S.E. 763, 1931 Va. LEXIS 280 (1931). Compliance with statute adequa tely shown.  Because the record contained an order entered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court prior to defendants trial, pursuant to subsection B of § 17.1-105, designating an Eleventh Judicial Circuit to preside over defendants trial after the judges of the Sixth Judicial Circuit recused themselves, the appeals court rejected defendants contrary claim. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 155 (V a. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2007). Failure to hold regular term c ontemplated.  This section and former §§ 17-22 and 17-23 (now § 17.1-120) contemplate that a regular term of court may not be held at all. Nicholas v. Commonwealth, 91 Va. 741, 21 S.E. 364, 1895 Va. LEXIS 73 (1895). Subs titute in disciplinary proceeding against attorney.  Former § 54-74 as it stood prior to the 1980 amendment did not prohibit the appointment of a substitute Commonwealths attorney pursuant to § 19.2-155 or the designation of a substitute judge in accordance with this section in a disciplinary proceeding brought against an attorney.

The Chief J ustice of the Supreme Court may call upon any judge of a circuit court who is retired under the Judicial Retirement System (§ 51.1-300 et seq.) and who has been found qualified within the preceding three years by the House Committee for Courts of Just ice and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to sit in recall either to (i) hear a specific case or cases pursuant to the provisions of § 17.1-105, such designation to continue in effect for the duration of the case or cases, or (ii) perform for a pe riod of time not to exceed 90 days at any one time such judicial duties in any circuit court as the Chief Justice shall deem in the public interest for the expeditious disposition of the business of the courts. B. It shall be the obligation of any retired judge who is recalled to temporary service under this section and who has not attained age 70 to accept the recall and perform the duties assigned. It shall be within the discretion of any judge who has attained age 70 to a ccept such recall. C. Any judge r ecalled to duty under this section shall have all the powers, duties, and privileges attendant on the position he is recalled to serve. D. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection A, the Chief Justice may call upon and authorize any judge of a circuit court whose retirement becomes effective during the interim period between regularly scheduled sessions of the General Assembly to sit in recall eit her to (i) hear a specific case or cases pursuant to the provisions of § 17.1-105, and such designation shall continue in effect for the duration of the case or cases, or (ii) perform, for a period of time not to exceed 90 days at any one time, such j udicial duties in any circuit court as the Chief Justice shall deem in the public interest for the expeditious disposition of the business of the courts. E. All retired circuit court judges who have requested to sit in recall shall be evaluated during the final year of the three-year period following qualification by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee for Courts of Justice using an evaluation form prepared and distributed by the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia. An annual report containing the results of such evaluations conducted that year shall be prepared and transmitted to the Senate Committee on the Jud iciary and the House Committee for Courts of Justice by the first day of the next regular session of the General Assembly.

CASE NOTES Challenge to constitutionality of retirement system held properly dismissed.  Suit brought by four former Virginia judges for a declaration that certain provisions of the Commonwealths judicial retirement system covering them were uncon stitutional, both under the equal protection clause of Amendment Fourteen of the Federal Constitution and under the Virginia Constitution, held properly dismissed. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985) (decided und er former § 51-178). Virginia acted reasonably in setting up its recall system, whether it be obligatory or m erely discretionary, for retired judges under 70 years of age. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985) (decided under former § 51-178). Purpose of recall/retirement system.  The clear purpose of the recall/retirement system is to insure the availability of a pool of auxiliary judges so that Virginia courts can more effectively address the problem of case backlogs. This system of benefits and burdens is rationally calculated to achieve this legitimate purpose; its general structure is well within any limitations imposed by the equal protection clause. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under former § 51-178). This section, by giving retired judges over 70 discretion to refuse recall, strikes a sensible balance between the needs of the recall system, on the one hand, and the realities of aging, on the other. The Constitution does not forbid this eminently reasonable accommodation of conflicting concerns. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1 984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under former § 51-178). Retired judge under 70 mus t serve if recalled.  The language of subsection D of this section is plain and unmistakable.

Decided under prior law. I.Decided under current law. Failure to sign a conviction order.  Conviction was affirmed as a trial judges failure to sign the conviction order did not deny defendant his right to due process and his right to equal protecti on under the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Miller v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 64 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 15, 2005). Authentication of orders.  Nothing in this section required the Commonwealth to introduce a document that was signed by a judge who convicted defendant of rape to have that document conside red by the trial court that convicted defendant of robbery, and the court that convicted defendant of robbery did not err when it considered documents that were not signed by the judge but were properly authenticated by his clerk. Seaton v. Commonwealth, 42 Va. App. 739, 595 S.E.2d 9, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 165 (2004). Absent contrary evidence, the courts presumed that public officials properly discharged their official duties; even though an order showing defendants prior c onviction did not show the trial judges signature, it was authenticated and certified by the clerk of the court, and became prima facie evidence of the conviction it showed.

Defendants conviction for possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a violent felony in violation of subsection A of § 18.2-308.2 was reversed because the circuit court orders showing his prior convictions were not authenticated by a judges signature as required by subsection A of § 17.1-123. Waller v. Commonwealth, 278 Va. 731, 685 S.E.2d 48, 2009 Va. LEXIS 100 (2009). As subsection A of § 17.1-123 did not make a conviction orders authentication, and subsequent admissibility, contingent upon the admission of an order show ing the beginning of the term of court during which the conviction was entered, and as the trial court could have taken judicial notice of the beginning of the term, defendants prior conviction order was properly admitted; therefore, there was suffic ient evidence to support defendants third domestic assault conviction. Lampkin v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. App. 726, 706 S.E.2d 51, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (2011). Circuit court did not err in admitting pages from an order book because it was maintained in conformity with clause (ii) of subsection A of § 17.1-123; even if subsection A of § 17.1-123 required that the identity of the presiding judge be ascertainable, the sequence of the various orders and the respective signatures of the judges indicated that one judge presided over the case under which his signature ap peared and the other judge presided over the cases, including defendants, under which his signature appeared. Hubbard v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 186 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 2017). Although clause (i) of subsection A of § 17.1-123 provides that an order book page shall be admissible when the judges signature is shown in the order, nei ther of the other permissible methods require that the judges signature appear on the individual order for it to be admissible. Hubbard v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 186 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 2017). Circuit court did not err in admitting into evidence the pages from an order book as proof of defendants prior convictions because the book was maintained in conformity with clause (ii) of subsection A, and thus, the pages were admissible as the records of a judicial proceeding and as official records of a court of this Commonwealth; the signatures of both judges who presided in the circuit court where the pr ior convictions were rendered shown in the order book. Hubbard v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 186 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 2017). Court orders were properly admitted under subsection A, and since defendant had only assigned error to the admissibility of the orders, the authenticity of the re cords was not properly before the court of appeals. Raspberry v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. App. 19, 833 S.E.2d 894, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 241 (2019). II.Decided under prior law. The purpose of this section is to provide for keeping the records of every court correctly, by making it the duty of the clerk to enter them in a book, and to read them in open court to the judge, and in the presence of the bar, so that any errors in or omissions from them might be corrected. Barnes v. Commonwealth, 92 Va. 794, 23 S.E. 784, 1895 Va. LEXIS 136 (1895) (see New York Life Ins. Co. v. Barton, 166 Va. 426, 186 S.E. 65 (1936)). A court speaks only through its orders. Cunningham v. Smith, 205 Va. 205, 135 S.E.2d 770, 1964 Va. LEXIS 166 (1964). Which must comply with law.  In those cases where the jurisdiction of the court depends upon compliance with certain mandatory provisions of law, the courts order, spread upon its order b ook, must show such compliance or jurisdiction is not obtained. Cunningham v. Smith, 205 Va. 205, 135 S.E.2d 770, 1964 Va. LEXIS 166 (1964). Court proceedings should be recorded as of the day they take place. Carpenter v. Commonwe alth, 193 Va. 851, 71 S.E.2d 377, 1952 Va. LEXIS 196 (1952). And should be entered chronologically.  Courts of record are required to maintain order books for the purpose of recording systematically the daily proceedings had in court. Orders should be entered by the clerk chronologically. McDowell v. Dye, 193 Va. 390, 69 S.E.2d 459, 1952 Va. LEXIS 147 (1952). All orders need not be recorded immediately.  It is not the practice in this State, and indeed it would be physically impossible, for the clerk to record all of the orders on the order book immediately, or fo r the judge forthwith to sign them. The universal practice is that the clerk extends the orders upon the permanent record of the court just as soon as possible, and they are thereafter read in open court and signed as orders of the date when the judgment s were pronounced. This practice is recognized by this section. Daley v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 621, 111 S.E. 111, 1922 Va. LEXIS 60 (1922). Court order carrying into effect its prior oral pronouncement should have been spread up on the order book under the date upon which it was approved and endorsed for entry and should not have been antedated as of the date of the oral pronouncement. McDowell v. Dye, 193 Va. 390, 69 S.E.2d 459, 1952 Va. LEXIS 147 (1952). Signing orders of last day of term authenticates all orders.  If only the orders of the last day of the term are signed, this is sufficient authentication of all the orders of the term which are spread on the record and whic h precede the signature of the judge, though the reasonable inference from this section is that the orders of each day should be separately signed. Weatherman v. Commonwealth, 91 Va. 796, 22 S.E. 349, 1895 Va. LEXIS 76 (1895). Presence of accused not necessary when orders signed.  It is not necessary that the accused should be present when orders are signed. Weatherman v. Commonwealth, 91 Va. 796, 22 S.E. 349, 1895 Va. LEXIS 76 (1895). Amen dment of record after the term.  After the term at which a case is tried the court cannot amend its records, unless there is something in the record by which amendments can be safely made. They c annot be made upon the individual recollection of the judge, or upon proof aliunde. Barnes v. Commonwealth, 92 Va. 794, 23 S.E. 784, 1895 Va. LEXIS 136 (1895) (see also Sydnor v. Burke, 25 Va. (4 Rand.) 161 (1826)). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Orders not signed by justices.  The courts procedures allowing routine orders to be endorsed by the clerks office and permitting the identities of panel members to remain undisclosed pos e no constitutional problems.

CASE NOTES Clerk must transact business during convenient hours.  It is a violation of the spirit of this section to permit a public officer to transact public business outside of his usual and convenient hours, so that among th ose entitled to an equal opportunity, one or more shall receive preferential treatment. It will, perhaps, be admitted that one cannot require a clerk of court to perform a public service outside of the convenient hours adopted for the transaction of busi ness and outside of his office. It ought not, therefore, to be left to the public official to voluntarily assume such responsibility, especially when the rights of others are affected thereby. Brumley v. Grimstead, 170 Va. 340, 196 S.E. 668, 1938 Va. LEX IS 192 (1938) (decided under prior law). While not required by statute to be kept open during specified hours, the office hours for the transaction of business shall be during convenient hours. I t can hardly be seriously contended that the hours between 12:00 midnight and 8:00 a.m. may be considered convenient, either for the great majority of persons having business to transact at that office, or for the employees of the office.

To the extent particular functions, including electronic filing procedures, can be kept operational in the absence of funding from the county and without staffing, the clerk sh ould do so.

Text A. For the pur poses of this section, confidential court records, court records, and nonconfidential court records shall have the same meaning as set forth in § 17.1-292. B. Except as o therwise provided by law, any records that are maintained by the clerks of the circuit courts shall be open to inspection in the office of the clerk by any person and the clerk shall, when requested, furnish copies thereof subject to any reasonable fee c harged by the clerk pursuant to § 17.1-275. No person shall be permitted to use the clerks office for the purpose of making copies of records in such manner, or to such extent, as will, in the determination of the clerk, interfere with the busines s of the office or with its reasonable use by the general public. The certificate of the clerk to copies furnished by the clerk shall, if the paper copied be recorded in a bound volume, contain the name and number of the volume and the page or folio at w hich the recordation of the paper begins, or the instrument number as applicable, and the clerk may charge a fee therefor pursuant to § 17.1-275. The certificate of the circuit court clerk to such copies may be provided electronically subject to the p rovisions of § 17.1-258.3:2. Such electronic certificate may reference an instrument number, bound volume, or other case number, but is not required to do so. C. Requests fo r copies of nonconfidential court records maintained in individual case files shall be made to the clerk of the circuit court. D. Requests fo r reports of aggregated, nonconfidential case data fields that are viewable through the online case information systems maintained by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court shall be made to the Office of the Executive Secretary. Such reports of agg regated case data shall not include the name, date of birth, or social security number of any party, and shall not include images of the individual records in the respective case files. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to permit any re ports of aggregated case data to be sold or posted on any other website or in any way redistributed to any third party. The clerk or the Executive Secretary, in his discretion, may deny such request to ensure compliance with these provisions. However, su ch data may be included in products or services provided to a third party, provided that such data is not made available to the general public. E. Any clerk o r the Executive Secretary, as applicable, may require that the request be in writing and that the requester provide his name and legal address. A request for nonconfidential court records or reports of aggregated, nonconfidential case data shall identify the requested records with reasonable specificity. Any clerk or the Executive Secretary, as applicable, may determine the costs for providing the requested records to the requester, advise the requester of such costs, and, before continuing to process t he request, require the requester to agree to payment of a deposit not to exceed the amount of the advance determination, which shall be credited to the final cost of supplying the requested records. Neither a clerk nor the Executive Secretary shall be r equired to create a new record if the record does not already exist or provide a report of aggregated, nonconfidential case data in a format not regularly used by the clerk or the Executive Secretary; however, a clerk or the Executive Secretary, as appli cable, may abstract or summarize information under such terms and conditions as agreed to by the requester and the clerk or Executive Secretary, as provided herein. F. Except as o therwise provided by law, the requested court records or reports of aggregated, nonconfidential case data shall be provided to the requester within a reasonable period of time, given the nature of the request and the availability of staff to respond to t he request, but in no event longer than 30 days from the date of a complete request made by a requester that is fully compliant with the requirements of this section and other applicable law. Any objection or assertion of confidentiality shall be provide d to the requester within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer than 30 days from the date of a complete request made by a requester. G. Any clerk o r the Executive Secretary may require payment in advance of all reasonable costs, not to exceed the actual cost incurred in accessing, duplicating, reviewing, supplying, or searching for the requested court records or reports of aggregated, nonconfidenti al case data, including removing any confidential information contained in the court records from the nonconfidential court records being provided, excluding any extraneous, intermediary, or surplus fees or expenses to recoup the general overhead costs a ssociated with creating or maintaining records or transacting the general business of the clerk or the Office of the Executive Secretary. Before processing a request for court records or reports of aggregated, nonconfidential case data, any clerk or the Executive Secretary may require the requester to pay any amounts owed to the clerk or the Office of the Executive Secretary for previous requests for court records or reports of aggregated, nonconfidential case data that remain unpaid 30 days or more aft er billing. H. Any clerk a nd the Executive Secretary shall be immune from any suit arising from the production of court records or reports of aggregated, nonconfidential case data in accordance with this section absent gross negligence or willful misconduct. I. Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to court records transferred to the Library of Virginia for permanent archiving pursuant to the duties imposed by the Virginia Public Records Act (§ 42.1-76 et seq.). In accordance with § 42.1-79, the Librar y of Virginia shall be the custodian of such permanently archived records and shall be responsible for responding to requests for such records.

Co mmon-law rule of openness subject to statutory exception.  Construing the language of this section as it has endured for more than a century, the court concluded that the General Assembly intended to recognize the general ly accepted common-law rule of openness and to declare its power to make statutory exceptions to the rule.

CASE NOTES The words or proper have been inserted in the statute since the decision of Comm onwealth v. Williamson, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 554 (1847), wherein it was held that a clerk, under the statute as it then was, had no authority, when applied to for a marriage license, to examine a witness on oath as to the age of the parties. The court const rued the law as it then stood to apply only to such cases in which, without regard to circumstances, the making of the affidavit was necessary as a prerequisite to the performance of the official act required of the clerk. But the legislature soon after that decision, by the revisal of 1849 having amended the law by inserting the words above recited, evidently designed to authorize the clerks and their deputies to administer an oath in such cases, because it is highly proper that the clerk, before issui ng a marriage license to parties who had not the consent of parents or guardians, or such evidence of it as the law required, should have authority to examine a witness on oath as to the age of the parties. The authority is given by the statute as it now stands. Maybush v. Commonwealth, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 857, 1878 Va.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Recordation taxes on documents intended to allow indi viduals of the Islamic faith to acquire real estate without violating a tenet of their religion.  A circuit court clerk should base the recordation taxes for a Security Instrument, which allows for the payment of profits as opposed to a traditional dee d of trust that is secured by a note requiring the payment of interest, on the original acquisition balance as defined in the instrument, and should assess separate fees for recording an Assignment Agreement, since the document contains two instr uments of equal dignity that serve independent purposes at law.

Use of cover sheets on deeds or other instruments by circuit court clerks. Text A. Circuit cou rt clerks may require that any deed or other instrument conveying or relating to an interest in real property be submitted for recordation with a cover sheet detailing the information contained in the deed or other instrument necessary for the clerk to p roperly index such instrument. The cover sheet shall be developed in conjunction with the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia and shall include the following information: (i) the name of each party to be indexed as grantor and the name of each party to be indexed as grantee and, in the case of any individual grantor or grantee, the surname of each individual identified as such; (ii) in the case of a deed or other instrument described in § 58.1-801 or 58.1-807, the amoun t of the consideration and the actual value of the property conveyed; (iii) the Virginia or federal law under which any exemption from recordation taxes is claimed; (iv) if required under § 17.1-252, the tax map reference number or numbers, or the par cel identification number (PIN) or numbers, of the affected parcel or parcels; and (v) the name and current address of the person to whom the instrument should be returned after recordation. B. In any cler ks office that does not require a cover sheet, the attorney or other party presenting a deed or other instrument conveying or relating to an interest in real property may submit a cover sheet with such deed or other instrument containing all of the i nformation required under subsection A, and in such case the deed or other instrument need not contain the information otherwise required to be included under subsection A of § 17.1-223, except that each page thereof shall be numbered consecutively as provided in subsection A of § 17.1-223. C. The attorne y or other party who prepares the cover sheet submitted with any deed or other instrument conveying or relating to an interest in real property for recordation has the responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of the information contained in the cover she et, and the clerk may rely on the information provided therein.The cover sheet may be recorded with the deed or other instrument with which it is submitted, but it shall not be included as a page for determining the amount of any applicable filing fees p ursuant to subdivision A 2 of § 17.1-275 except in the case of a cover sheet submitted pursuant to subsection B. The cover sheet shall be provided only for information purposes to facilitate the recordation of the deed or other instrument with which i t is submitted. The cover sheet shall not be construed to convey title to any interest in real property, purport to be a document in the chain of title conveying any interest in real property, or be considered a part of, or affect the interpretation of, the deed or other instrument with which it is submitted, regardless of whether the clerk records the cover sheet with such instrument.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases cited below were decided under prior law. This sec tion gives effect to constitutional provision.  The original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in mandamus cases, provided in former § 88 (see now Va. Const., Art. VI, § 1) of the Constitution of Virginia , is carried into effect by this section. Miller v. Ayres, 211 Va. 69, 175 S.E.2d 253, 1970 Va. LEXIS 213 (1970). Provisions of Constitution as to mandamus and prohibition not self-executing.  The provisions of former § 88 (see now Va. Const., Art. VI, § 1) of the Constitution of Virginia providing for the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in mand amus and prohibition cases, whether original or appellate, are not self-executing but require, to be carried into effect, an act of the legislature. Price v. Smith, 93 Va. 14, 24 S.E. 474, 1896 Va. LEXIS 46 (1896). Jurisdiction coextensive with that exercised at common law.  The jurisdiction which the Supreme Court exercises, under this section in the matter of mandamus, is coextensive with that exercised at common law by the court of Kings Bench in England. Harrison v. Barksdale, 127 Va. 180, 102 S.E. 789, 1920 Va. LEXIS 43 (1920). Exercise of jurisdiction n ot discretionary.  The exercise of its jurisdiction in mandamus cases is no more left to the discretion of the Court than is the exercise of its jurisdiction generally. Clay v. Ball ard, 87 Va. 787, 13 S.E. 262, 1891 Va. LEXIS 128 (1891). Mandamus lies only to compel the performance of ministerial acts or duties and not to co mpel the performance of discretionary acts or duties. City of Richmond v. Hayes, 212 Va. 428, 184 S.E.2d 784, 1971 Va. LEXIS 367 (1971). A ministerial act is an act that one performs in obedience to a legal mandate and in a p rescribed manner, without regard to his own judgment as to the propriety of the act to be done. City of Richmond v. Hayes, 212 Va. 428, 184 S.E.2d 784, 1971 Va. LEXIS 367 (1971). Mandamus will not issue to require a local political unit to exercise its discretionary legislative function in levying taxes and appropriating funds for the maintenance of public schools. Griffin v. Board of Supvrs., 203 Va. 321, 124 S.E.2d 227, 1962 Va. LEXIS 146 (1962). Mandamus awarded to allow inspection of poll books.  The Court has jurisdiction to award mandamus to compel a clerk, who is the custodian of the poll books after election, to permit a party interested to inspect the m, and to take memoranda and notes therefrom. Keller v. Stone, 96 Va. 667, 32 S.E. 454, 1899 Va. LEXIS 117 (1899). Mandamus to require Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner to condemn land.  The original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court could not be invoked to issue a writ of mandamus to require the State Highway Commissioner to condemn land which he believed already to be property of the State. A declaratory judgment proceeding is an adequate means for determining the ownership of such land. Gilliam v. Harris, 203 Va. 316, 124 S.E.2d 188, 1962 Va.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Scope of habeas corpus jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus. However, only the circuit court which entered the original judgment order of convi ction may issue a writ for one held under criminal process. The Supreme Courts grant of original jurisdiction in habeas corpus matters is not subject to this limitation. However, the Court of Appeals grant of jurisdiction in these matters is limi ted. Bullock v. Director of Dep't of Cors., 1 Va. App. 70, 334 S.E.2d 150, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 63, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1023, 106 S. Ct. 576, 88 L. Ed. 2d 559, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 4816 (1985). The Supreme Court was given original, but not exclusive jurisdiction, over habeas corpus petitions by former § 88 (see now Va. Const., Art. VI, § 1) of the Constitution of Virginia, Rule 5:5 of the Rules of Court and this section. Creasy v. McConnell, 262 F. Supp. 697, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7516 (W.D. Va. 1966). While the Supreme Court now has original jurisdiction to award the writ of habeas corpus, this does not mean exclusive jurisdiction. Hall v. Verdel, 40 F. Supp. 9 41, 1941 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2814 (D. Va. 1941). Constitutional provision in regard to habeas corpus not self-executing.  Former § 88 (see now Va. Const., Art. VI, § 1) of the Virginia Constitution which provides that the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction only, ex cept in cases of habeas corpus, etc., does not, proprio vigore, confer jurisdiction on it in these cases. The exception simply invests the court with capacity to receive original jurisdiction in that class of cases in the event the legislature shall see fit to confer the jurisdiction. Prison Ass'n v. Ashby, 93 Va. 667, 25 S.E. 893, 1896 Va. LEXIS 123 (1896). The doctrine of res judicata does not limit the availability of habeas corpus in Virgini a. Ferguson v. Cox, 464 F.2d 461, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 8211 (4th Cir. 1972). Court has jurisdiction to grant writ of habeas corpus to determine validity of statute.  The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to grant a writ of habeas corpus to determine the validity of the statute and procedure under which a person was adjudged insan e and committed to an institution.

For related discussion, see 1A M.J. Administrative Law, § 3. The 1999 amendment substituted $200 for $150. CASE NOTES Challenge to constitutionality of retirement system held properly dismissed.  Suit brought by four former Virginia judges for a declaration that certain provisions of the Commonwealths judicial retirement system covering them were uncon stitutional, both under the equal protection clause of Amendment Fourteen of the Federal Constitution and under the Virginia Constitution, held properly dismissed. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985) (decided und er former § 51-178). Virginia acted reasonably in setting up its recall system, whether it be obligatory or m erely discretionary, for retired judges under 70 years of age. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985) (decided under former § 51-178). Purpose of recall/retirement system.  The clear purpose of the recall/retirement system is to insure the availability of a pool of auxiliary judges so that Virginia courts can more effectively address the problem of case backlogs. This system of benefits and burdens is rationally calculated to achieve this legitimate purpose; its general structure is well within any limitations imposed by the equal protection clause. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under former § 51-178). This section, by giving retired judges over 70 discretion to refuse recall, strikes a sensible balance between the needs of the recall system, on the one hand, and the realities of aging, on the other. The Constitution does not forbid this eminently reasonable accommodation of conflicting concerns. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1 984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under former § 51-178). Retired judge under 70 mus t serve if recalled.  The language of subsection D of former § 51-178 is plain and unmistakable. It could not be clearer: A retired judge under 70 must serve if recalled. Thompson v . Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under former § 51-178). Retired judge who both receives retirement benefits and appears in Virginia courts viola tes former § 51-179 and Canon 8(C) of the Canons of Judicial Conduct, which incorporates and interprets this section. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under former § 51-178). Workers Compensation Commission.  Matter was not heard before a properly constituted full Virginia Workers Compensation Commission because only two of the three statutorily authorized commissi oners decided it; because the Commissions authority is a matter of legislative prerogative, the Commission is bound by the plain meaning of the words in the Workers Compensation Act, and § 17.1-327, which fail to provide the authority to recal l or designate a retired commissioner to serve in a review proceeding. Layne v. Crist Elec. Contr., Inc., 62 Va. App. 632, 751 S.E.2d 679, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 371 (2013). By implication, the statute was not intended by the legislature to provide the authority for the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission to recall or designa te a retired commissioner to serve on a review panel; the General Assembly has not enacted legislation authorizing retired members of the Commission to sit on the Commission or defining who is to effect the recall.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or, if the Chief Justice is unavailable, the justice longes t in continuous service who is available, shall have the power to declare by order a judicial emergency (i) for any court upon the request of the Governor, (ii) for the Supreme Court sua sponte, (iii) for the Court of Appeals, upon the request of the chi ef judge of the Court of Appeals or, if the chief judge is unavailable, the judge of the Court of Appeals longest in continuous service who is available, or (iv) for any circuit or district court upon the request of the chief judge of the affected circui t or district court or, if the chief judge is unavailable, the judge from the affected circuit or district court longest in continuous service who is available.

The order shall become effective for each affected court upon the date set forth in the order or, if no date is set forth in the order, u pon the date the order is signed. C. Notwithstan ding any other provision of law, an order declaring a judicial emergency may designate a neighboring city or county not affected by the disaster for the temporary relocation of the affected circuit or district court. Locations designated under this secti on may be outside the geographical limits of the affected courts circuit or district.If an affected circuit or district court conducts sessions in a city or county not affected by the disaster pursuant to this section, the unaffected city or county s hall be a proper venue for civil and criminal actions to the same extent as if the affected court were operating in its original city or county. An affected circuit court may, upon motion of either party, and for good cause shown, summon jurors from the jurisdiction where the affected circuit court has been temporarily relocated. D. Notwithstan ding any other provision of law, such order may suspend, toll, extend, or otherwise grant relief from deadlines, time schedules, or filing requirements imposed by otherwise applicable statutes, rules, or court orders in any court processes and proceeding s, including all appellate court time limitations.

CASE NOTES Judicial emergency.  Order established a 55-day deadline for filing any motions relating to the protective order or attorney fees, and that deadline remained tolled until the Virginia Supreme Court entered a judicial emergency order related to the pandemic that terminated the tolling of case-related deadlines; thus, the court reversed the circuit courts denial of appellants motion for order of production and entry of a protec tive order based on the timeliness of its filing. Petersen v. Robertston, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 112 (Va. Ct. App. July 6, 2021). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Delay in commencement of trial due to pandemic.  Continuance of defendants criminal trial was necessitated and the time period during which the court was not conducting criminal jury or bench trials due to t he COVID-19 emergency was excludable because the coronavirus pandemic constituted a natural disaster, as it was a communicable disease of public health threat, and the court found that it could not protect the health and safety of the trial participants if it conducted a jury trial in the midst of the judicial emergency and pandemic. Commonwealth v. Vila, 104 Va. Cir. 389, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 39 (Fairfax County Mar. 30, 2020). Insureds claim against their insurer was timely filed because the Virginia Supreme Court, relying on its statutory authority, granted relief from all deadline s due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the United States Supreme Court stated that a court usually may pause the running of a limitations statute in private litigation when some extraordinary circumstance prevents the plaintiff from meeting a deadline.

Code Ann. § 17.1-330(D), tolled limitations period for all cases with limitations periods running during the emergency period and not only to those that expired during the tolling period. Beasley v. Berkle, 2022 Va. Cir. LEXIS 80 (Henrico Count y June 16, 2022). Spousal support proceeding tolled.  Court had jurisdiction to hear a motion for spousal support filed on the last day of the 1.5 year period for which the court reserved the issue of spousal support in the parties final decree of divorce because the period for which spousal support was reserved was tolled from March 16, 2020, through July 19, 2020, pursuant to this section due to the COVID-19 pandemic, just under one year had passed from entry of the final decree on March 27, 2019, and just over half of a year remained once it ended, and extending the deadline for half of a year from July 20, 2020, rendered the reinstatement on October 1, 2020, timely.

The Court o f Appeals of Virginia is hereby established effective January 1, 1985. It shall consist of 17 judges who shall be elected for terms of eight years by the majority of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly. The General Assembly shall co nsider regional diversity in making its elections. Before entering upon the duties of the office, a judge of the Court of Appeals shall take the oath of office required by law. The oath shall be taken before a justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia or before any officer authorized by law to administer an oath. When any vacancy exists while the General Assembly is not in session, the Governor may appoint a successor to serve until 30 days after the commencement of the next regular session of the Genera l Assembly. Whenever a vacancy occurs or exists in the office of a judge of the Court of Appeals while the General Assembly is in session, or when the term of office of a judge of the Court of Appeals will expire or the office will be vacant or vacated a t a date certain between the adjournment of the General Assembly and the commencement of the next session of the General Assembly, a successor may be elected at any time during a session preceding the date of such vacancy by the vote of a majority of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly for a full term and, upon qualification, the successor shall enter at once upon the discharge of the duties of the office; however, such successor shall not qualify prior to the predecessor leaving o ffice. No person shall be elected or reelected to a subsequent term under this section until he has submitted to a criminal history record search and submitted to a search of the central registry maintained pursuant to § 63.2-1515 for any founded comp laint of child abuse or neglect and reports of such searches have been received by the chairmen of the House Committee for Courts of Justice and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. If the person has not met the requirement of filing in the preceding c alendar year a disclosure form prescribed in § 2.2-3117 or 30-111, he shall also provide a written statement of economic interests on the disclosure form prescribed in § 2.2-3117 to the chairmen of the House Committee for Courts of Justice and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.All judges of the Court of Appeals shall be residents of the Commonwealth and shall, at least five years prior to the appointment or election, have been licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth. No judge of the Court of Appeals, during his continuance in office, shall engage in the practice of law within or without the Commonwealth or seek or accept any nonjudicial elective office, or hold any other office of public trust, or engage in any other incompatible activit y. B. The chief j udge shall be elected by majority vote of the judges of the Court of Appeals to serve a term of four years. C. If a judge of the Court of Appeals is absent or unable through sickness, disability, or any other reason to perform or discharge any official duty or function authorized or required by law, a (i) retired chief justice or retired justice of the Supreme Court of Virg inia, (ii) retired chief judge or retired judge of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, or (iii) retired judge of a circuit court of Virginia, with his or her prior consent, may be appointed by the chief judge of the Court of Appeals, acting upon his own in itiative or upon a personal request from the absent or disabled judge, to perform or discharge the official duties or functions of the absent or disabled judge until that judge shall again be able to attend his duties.

CASE NOTES As used in subsection C, acting independently merely means that each panel must decide o n its own the cases it hears, and not that it is free from traditional rules of decision, such as stare decisis. Commonwealth v. Burns, 240 Va. 171, 395 S.E.2d 456, 7 Va. Law Rep. 100, 1990 Va. LEXIS 109 (1990) (decided under prior law). Applying the rule of stare decisis in the court of appeals would not mean that a panel d ecision, no matter how wrong, would be forever binding. If there is flagrant error or mistake in a panel decision, the error or mistake may be corrected through the en banc hearing process. Commonwealth v. Burns, 240 Va. 171, 395 S.E.2d 456, 7 V a. Law Rep. 100, 1990 Va. LEXIS 109 (1990) (decided under prior law). Application of Commonwealth for rehearing en banc denied where subsection D requirements not met.  Where, by an unpublished memorandum opinion, a unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals reversed and dismissed a conviction, and there was neither a dissent in the panel nor a certification that the decision conflicted with a prior decision of the Court, neither requirement of subsection D of this section for an en banc hearing was satisfied, and accordingly, the application of the Commonwealth for a rehearing en banc would be denied. Grajales v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 1, 353 S.E.2d 789, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1815, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 158 (1987) (decided under prior law). Trial court ju dgment may be reversed by court en banc.  The judgment referred to in subsection E that is subject to reversal in whole or part by a majority of the court sitting en banc includes the judgment entered by the trial court. Cochran v. Commonwealth, 258 Va. 604, 521 S.E.2d 287, 1999 Va. LEXIS 119 (1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1075, 120 S. Ct. 1692, 146 L. Ed. 2d 498, 2000 U.S. LEXIS 2722 (2000). Panels decision was a judgment within terms of subsection E.  Court of appeals erred in dismissing defendants petition for a writ of actual innocence because under subsection E of § 17.1-402, the panels decision w as a judgment within the terms of subsection E since it disposed of all issues in the case and ordered the issuance of a writ of actual innocence, and that judgment could only have been withdrawn and reversed by a majority of the judges sitting in the co urt of appeals en banc; the proceedings of the court of appeals en banc, therefore, had no effect on the panels decision. Conley v. Commonwealth, 284 Va. 691, 733 S.E.2d 927, 2012 Va. LEXIS 200 (2012). Subsection E plain and unambiguous.  Language of subsection E of § 17.1-402 is plain and unambiguous; it applies to all cases decided by the court of appeals en banc, without any distinction betwe en the courts appellate or original jurisdiction.

CASE NOTES Argument dispensed with.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission awarded a claimant temporary partial disability benefits and found she made a good faith effort to market her residua l work capacity; the court summarily affirmed pursuant to § 17.1-403 and Va. Sup. Ct. Rule 5A:27 because the facts and legal contentions were adequately presented and argument would not have aided the decisional process. Family Care Home Health, Inc. v. Nye, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 388 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 10, 2004). Based on the parties briefs, the record, and the Workers Compensation Commissions opinion, the court found that the claimants appeal was without m erit; the court dispensed with oral argument and summarily affirmed pursuant to § 17.1-403, and Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:27 because the facts and legal contentions were adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the de cisional process. Grantham v. B &amp; S Landscaping, Inc., 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 433 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 23, 2008). Court of appeals dispensed with oral argument and summarily affirmed the decisions of the Workers Compensation Commission because the facts and legal contenti ons were adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. Foust v. Lawrence Bros., 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 319 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2019). Case was wholly without merit; thus, oral argument was unnecessary. Leblanc v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 328 (Va. Ct. App. July 26, 2022). Interpretation of Supreme Court Rule s.  General assembly had empowered the Supreme Court of Virginia to promulgate the rules of practice and procedure both for circuit courts and for the Court of Appeal s of Virginia; consequently, while Va. Sup. Ct. R. pt. 5A governed the proceedings of the Court of Appeals, the provisions of Part 5A remained precisely that  rules of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the Supreme Court reviews the Court of Appeals interpretation of rules de novo. LaCava v. Commonwealth, 283 Va. 465, 722 S.E.2d 838, 2012 Va.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under prior law. The Court of Appeals is without jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus appeals arising from convictions where the death penalty has been imposed. Peterson v. Bass, 2 Va. App. 314, 343 S.E.2d 475, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 274, aff'd, 349 S.E.2d 409, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1103 (Va. Ct. App. 1986). Scope of habeas corpus jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus. However, only the circuit court which entered the original judgment order of convi ction may issue a writ for one held under criminal process. The Supreme Courts grant of original jurisdiction in habeas corpus matters is not subject to this limitation. However, the Court of Appeals grant of jurisdiction in these matters is limi ted. Bullock v. Director of Dep't of Cors., 1 Va. App. 70, 334 S.E.2d 150, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 63, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1023, 106 S. Ct. 576, 88 L. Ed. 2d 559, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 4816 (1985). The Court of Appeals habeas corpus jurisdiction, whether appellate or original, must be defined with reference to the cases over which it has jurisdic tion on direct appeal. Peterson v. Bass, 2 Va. App. 314, 343 S.E.2d 475, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 274, aff'd, 349 S.E.2d 409, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1103 (Va. Ct. App. 1986). Original jur isdiction to issue writ of habeas corpus.  The 1985 amendment to § 17-116.05:1 [see now § 17.1-406] did not alter this section and sound principles of statutory interpretation require that the Court of Appeals give effect to all provisions of the Code and recognize that the Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus in appropriate cases. Appellate courts historically have had, and jurisprudentially should have, discre tionary original jurisdiction to issue extraordinary writs in aid of their appellate jurisdiction. White v. Garraghty, 2 Va. App. 117, 341 S.E.2d 402, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 248 (1986). Since the Court of Appeals has subject matter jurisdiction over the issues raised by the appellants petition for a writ of habeas corpus, under this section t he Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to entertain an original petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by an inmate who wishes to challenge the validity of his detention in appropriate cases. This in no way limits the clear legislative intent expressed in the 1985 amendment to § 17-116.05:1 [see now § 17.1-406] that habeas corpus cases on appeal from the circuit courts go directly to the Supreme Court. White v. Garraghty, 2 Va. App. 117, 341 S.E.2d 402, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 248 (1986). No jurisdiction on appeal from habeas corpus proceeding in circuit court.  It is clear from the 1985 amendment to § 17-116.05:1 B [see now § 17.1-406 B] that effective July 1, 1985, the General Assembly terminated the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to hear and determine appeals from a final decision, judgment or order of a circuit court involving a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. White v. Garraghty, 2 Va. App. 117, 341 S.E.2d 402, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 248 (1986). Existence of r emedy in circuit court under § 8.01-654.  The Court of Appeals should not consider an original petition for a writ of habeas corpus when an adequate remedy may be had in the circuit courts under § 8.01 -654. White v. Garraghty, 2 Va. App. 117, 341 S.E.2d 402, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 248 (1986). Jurisdiction over prohibition writ.  Court had appellate jurisdiction over matters involving divorce and judgments for civil contempt of court; thus, the issues raised in the petition for a writ of p rohibition fell within the courts subject matter jurisdiction. The court rejected the claim that a final order was necessary to invoke the courts original jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition. Hoffman P'ship, LLP v. Circuit Court, 72 Va. A pp. 206, 843 S.E.2d 396, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 175 (2020). Prohibition writ denied.  Wife asserted in her complaint for divorce that the partnership was marital property and she asked for the right to control and manage the partnership; since the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction over the divorce proceedings, including the power to determine the ownership and value of all property, the writ of prohibition did not lie. The circuit court had already entered two orders directing husband, not the partnership, to undertake certain actions, and prohibition did not lie to undo those orders. Hoffman P'ship, LLP v. Circuit Court, 72 Va. App. 206, 843 S.E.2d 396, 2020 Va.

Some of the cases cited below were decided under prior law. Cases over which Court of Appeals has appellate jurisdiction are defined with reference to subject matter of the case and not the procedural means used to raise the issues. The petition for a writ of habeas corpus is a procedural device that is used to raise a wide variety of issues that may or may not involve criminal m atters. White v. Garraghty, 2 Va. App. 117, 341 S.E.2d 402, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 248 (1986). Rulings on discovery issues not generally within courts jurisdiction.  Ordinarily, a trial courts discovery orders are not subject to review on direct appeal because they are not final within the contemplation of this section; th us, because a trial courts denial of a motion to quash a subpoena neither adjudicated the underlying cause nor related to an attendant injunction but simply resolved an issue arising from discovery incidental to the claim, it was clearly an interlocu tory determination over which the appellate court had no jurisdiction. Blue Fox, Inc. v. Rogers, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 272 (Va. Ct. App. May 22, 2001). Orders by the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission compelling a benefits recipient to comply with discovery requests were not appealable; the orders did n ot affect the recipients benefits, as there had been no request for review of the award, nor had the recipient been sanctioned for failing to comply with the discovery orders. Green v. Keil Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., 42 Va. App. 539, 593 S.E.2d 525, 2 004 Va. App. LEXIS 108 (2004). Appeal of right.  Because an order barring all future appeals, regardless of their subject matter or merit, until a monetary sanction was paid, effectively closed the doors to the Court of Appeals on a father, including appeals of right under § 17.1-405, the sanction of dismissal under § 8.01-271.1 was unduly severe. Switzer v. Switzer, 273 Va. 326, 641 S.E.2d 80, 2007 Va. LEXIS 34 (2007). Court of appeals had jurisdiction to hear a husbands appeal pursuant to the statute because the rule that the common law prohibition in Virginia against an ap peal of a trial courts refusal to find a party in contempt had not been abrogated by the General Assembly; the husband assigned error to the circuit courts order that he pay the wife in equitable distribution based on its interpretation of the pa rties separation agreement and final divorce decree. Monds v. Monds, 68 Va. App. 674, 813 S.E.2d 1, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 124 (2018). Writ of coram vobis.  Because a writ of coram vobis fell outside the categories in § 17.1-405, the appellate court had no jurisdiction to address it; accordingly, the matter was tra nsferred to the state supreme court pursuant to § 8.01-677.1.Draghia v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. App. 291, 678 S.E.2d 272, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 290 (2009). Order remanding matt er to agency not appealable.  Because a trial courts order did not address the merits of a sanction imposed on real estate agents by the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupationa l Regulation, Real Estate Board, but remanded the matter for further consideration, its order was not a final decision within the meaning of this section, and the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider the Boards appeal. Commonwealt h v. Lancaster, 45 Va. App. 723, 613 S.E.2d 828, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (2005). Where the trial court remanded to the Virginia State Health Commissioner because the administrative record was incomplete, the courts order was not appealable , as it did not adjudicate the principles of the cause; the trial judge did not issue rulings or actual limitations such that it was necessary for the Commissioner to apply those rules or methods to the facts of the case in order to ascertain the rights of the parties in the action. Loudoun Hosp. Ctr. v. Stroube, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 534 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2005). Circuit courts order remanding an employment matter to a hearing officer for a new hearing because a tape of the grievance proceedings had been lost, precludi ng its review of the hearing officers decision, and was not a final order as required for jurisdiction pursuant to subdivision 1 of § 17.1-405; therefore, the court did not have jurisdiction of the employers appeal. Va. Dep't of Corr. v. Hodge s, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 148 (Va. Ct. App. May 3, 2011). Appeal by witness of discovery order not within courts jurisdiction.  Because a witness who brought a motion to quash a subpoena was not a party to the underlying proceedings, the court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal; u nless and until the witness ref...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_17.1-406"><akn:num>§ 17.1-406</akn:num><akn:heading>Appeals in criminal matters; cases over which Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Some of the cases cited below were decided under prior law. Constitutionality.  The right to appellate review is a statutory right and is not a necessary element of due process; thus, no due process violation occurs if an appeal is barred. Pa yne v. Commonwealth, 233 Va. 460, 357 S.E.2d 500, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2720, 1987 Va. LEXIS 215, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 933, 108 S. Ct. 308, 98 L. Ed. 2d 267, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 4520 (1987). The statutes which limit review of a death penalty case to the Supreme Court do not violate equal protection rights, as it is rational for the General Assembly, g iven the gravity of cases involving a sentence to death, to provide death-penalty defendants as automatic, plenary review in the Commonwealths highest court. Payne v. Commonwealth, 233 Va. 460, 357 S.E.2d 500, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2720, 1987 Va. LEXIS 215, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 933, 108 S. Ct. 308, 98 L. Ed. 2d 267, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 4520 (1987). No final order of conviction.  Where a motion to nolle prosequi a misdemeanor charge was granted, no final order of conviction was entered; as a result, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction under clause (i) of subsection A of § 17.1-406 to entertain an appeal of the interlocutory order. Everett v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 578 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 12, 2003). Defendants appeal of his conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol was dismissed because the court of appeals did not have jurisdiction over the a ppeal of his conviction under Amherst County, Va., Code § 9.1, which was based upon an order correcting a sentencing order, since defendant failed to file a timely notice of appeal that named the proper prosecuting authority, and the sentencing order was the final appealable conviction order; the corrected order, which was entered pursuant to subsection B of § 8.01-428, merely fixed a clerical error and clarified that defendant was convicted under the Amherst County Code, and subsection B of § 8.01-428 was a prescriptive statutory provision simply providing a mechanism to correct non-substantive errors in the record and neither enhanced nor diminished the jurisdiction of the court of appeals. Woody v. County of Amherst, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. July 20, 2010). Court of appeals lacked subject matter jurisdiction over defendants challenge to the trial courts finding of good cause to grant the Commonwealths mot ion to nolle prosequi because defendant did not appeal a decision of the trial court leading to his convictions; defendant challenged the trial courts good cause finding with respect to the initial indictments, which became a legal nullity once the t rial court entered the nolle prosequi. Truman v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 81 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 27, 2018). When the Virginia Supreme Court dismissed defendants appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss a case in which defendant was found incompetent to stand tr ial for lack of jurisdiction due to the appeals criminal nature, the case was not transferred to the Virginia Court of Appeals because there had been no final conviction. Martinez v. Commonwealth, 296 Va. 387, 821 S.E.2d 529, 2018 Va. LEXIS 176 (2018 ). Appellate court lacked jurisdiction to address the issue which defendant sought to raise on appeal because the circuit courts dismissal of defendants atte mpted appeal of the district courts grant of the Commonwealth of Virginias motion to nolle prosequi the charge against defendant was not a conviction, final or otherwise, as defendant was not convicted of anything in any court. Forness v. Commonw ealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 164 (Va. Ct. App. May 17, 2022). Order deferring disposition was not a final judgment of conviction.  Appellate court lacked jurisdiction to hear defendants appeal because the trial courts order deferring disposition did not constitute a final judgment of conviction; the trial courts order required further action, either an adjudication of guilty upon violation of probation or the dismissal upon fulfillment of the conditions of probation. Randolph v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 166, 609 S.E.2d 84, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 77 (2005).

The clerk shall endorse thereon the day and year he received it. B. Appeals pur suant to § 17.1-405 and subsection A of § 17.1-406, other than petitions for appeal by the Commonwealth in criminal cases, are appeals of right. The clerk of the Court of Appeals shall refer each case for which a notice of appeal has been filed to a panel of the court as the court may direct. C. Each petiti on for appeal by the Commonwealth in a criminal case shall be referred to one or more judges of the Court of Appeals as the court shall direct. A judge to whom the petition is referred may grant the petition on the basis of the record without the necessi ty of oral argument. The clerk shall refer each appeal for which a petition has been granted to a panel of the court as the court shall direct. D. Before a pe tition for appeal by the Commonwealth is denied, counsel for the Commonwealth shall be entitled to state orally before a panel of the court the reasons why its appeal should be granted. If all of the judges of the panel to whom the petition is referred a re of the opinion that the petition ought not be granted, the order denying the appeal shall state the reasons for the denial. Thereafter, no other petition in the matter shall be entertained in the Court of Appeals. History History. 1984, c. 701, § 17-116.05:2; 1988, cc. 71, 479; 1998, c. 872; 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 489.

Pa yne v. Commonwealth, 233 Va. 460, 357 S.E.2d 500, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2720, 1987 Va. LEXIS 215, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 933, 108 S. Ct. 308, 98 L. Ed. 2d 267, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 4520 (1987) (decided under prior law). The statutes which limit review of a death penalty case to the Supreme Court do not violate equal protection rights, as it is rational for the General Assembly, g iven the gravity of cases involving a sentence to death, to provide death-penalty defendants as automatic, plenary review in the Commonwealths highest court. Payne v. Commonwealth, 233 Va. 460, 357 S.E.2d 500, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2720, 1987 Va. LEXIS 215, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 933, 108 S. Ct. 308, 98 L. Ed. 2d 267, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 4520 (1987) (decided under prior law). Failure to timely file notice of appeal naming indispensable party required dismissal.  Mothers appeal of the termination of her parental rights was dismissed due to her failure to timely name the childrens guardian ad litem, an indispensable party under § 16.1-266, as an appellee in either the notice of appeal or the accompanying certificate of service; the failure to name the guardian ad litem as an appellee meant that the appeal was not perfected under Rule 5A:16, and the appellate cou rt never acquired jurisdiction over guardian ad litem. Watkins v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs., 42 Va. App. 760, 595 S.E.2d 19, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 164 (2004). Time for filing notice of appeal.  Wifes appeal of the trial courts denial of her motion for judgment alleging that the husband breached the parties marital settlement agreement was dis missed, as the wifes failure to file a notice of appeal from that ruling within 30 days of the date the trial court entered it meant that appellate court did not have jurisdiction to consider an appeal of that ruling. Samuel v. Samuel, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 41 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 28, 2004). Time for filing an estates appeal began to run from the trial courts entry of its order marked final for purposes of appeal and not from any earli er order. Estate of Hackler v. Hackler, 44 Va. App. 51, 602 S.E.2d 426, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 454 (2004). Challe nges to trial courts earlier rulings time-barred.  Appellant failed to perfect an appeal of orders not included in his notice of appeal where appellant only included a trial court order finding him in contempt in his notice of appeal; failure to include earlier rulings of the trial court in citations of error as required by § 17.1-408 and in failing to appeal such orders or decrees within 30 days pursuant to this section, did not perfect the appeal within the allotted time and required a dismissal of those issues as time-barred.

Wifes appeal of the trial courts denial of her motion for judgment alleging that the husband breached the parties marital settlement agreement was dis missed, as the wifes failure to file a notice of appeal from that ruling within 30 days of the date the trial court entered it meant that appellate court did not have jurisdiction to consider an appeal of that ruling. Samuel v. Samuel, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 41 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 28, 2004). Time requirement for filing interlocutory appeal by Commonwealth in criminal cases.  In reading §§ 17.1-408 and 19.2-402 and Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12 together and giving effect to as much of their respective provisions as possible, in any inter locutory appeal by the Commonwealth in a criminal case, a petition for appeal that is compliant with the provisions of Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12(c)(1) must be filed within fourteen days of the receipt by the clerk of the trial court of the transcript or writ ten statement of facts or, if there are objections thereto, within fourteen days after the judge signs the transcript or written statement of facts, and, in such cases, the Virginia Court of Appeals has no authority to grant an extension of time for any reason, and any grant of such authority to that Court must come from the general assembly. Commonwealth v. Square, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (Va. Ct. App. June 12, 2012). Fourteen-day time limit in the more specific and more recent expression of legislative intent of § 19.2-402 applies to interlocutory appeals by the Commonwealt h in criminal cases, rather than the forty-day time limit of § 17.1-408. Commonwealth v. Square, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (Va. Ct. App. June 12, 2012). Court of Appeals lacked authority to grant extension for filing appeal.  When the Commonwealths petition for an interlocutory appeal appealing an order granting a motion to suppress did not contain assignments of error, the appella te court erroneously granted an extension of time within which to file a proper petition and had no jurisdiction to consider the petition because (1) the requirement of assignments of error was jurisdictional, (2) the legislature intended in §§ 19. 2-402 and 17.1-408 to expeditiously dispose of such appeals, (3) § 19.2-402 did not let the appellate court grant an extension in such cases, (4) § 19.2-402, reducing the time to file an interlocutory petition for appeal to fourteen days, governed, as the statute was a more specific and more recent expression of legislative intent, and (5) § 19.2-402s incorporation of Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12 did not include authority to grant extensions of time, so (6) the general assembly did not intend to g rant extensions to file a petition for appeal in these cases. Commonwealth v. Square, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (Va. Ct. App. June 12, 2012). Additional timely notice of appeal filing unnecessary after delayed appeal award.  Where a timely notice of appeal has been filed on direct appeal but the appeal is dismissed for failure to perfect it and a delayed appeal has subsequently been a warded, an appellant need not file another timely notice of appeal after the delayed appeal is awarded. Sanchez v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 256, 416 S.E.2d 705, 17 Va. Law Rep. 2563, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 115 (1992) (decided under prior law). Challe nges to trial courts earlier rulings time-barred.  Appellant failed to perfect an appeal of orders not included in his notice of appeal where appellant only included a trial court order finding him in contempt in his notice of appeal; failure to include earlier rulings of the trial court in citations of error as required by this section and in failing to appeal such orders or decrees within 30 days pursuant to § 17.1-407, did not perfect the appeal within the allotted time and required a dismissal of those issues as time-barred. Homecare of Va., Inc. v. Jones, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 178 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 20, 2004). Failure to timely file notice of appeal naming indispensable party required dismissal.  Mothers appeal of the termination of her parental rights was dismissed due to her failure to timely name the childrens guardian ad litem, an indispensable party under § 16.1-266, as an appellee in either the notice of appeal or the accompanying certificate of service; the failure to name the guardian ad litem as an appellee meant that the appeal was not perfected under Rule 5A:16, and the appellate cou rt never acquired jurisdiction over the guardian ad litem. Watkins v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs., 42 Va. App. 760, 595 S.E.2d 19, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 164 (2004). Amendment of assignments of error.  Appellate court exercised its discretion to grant defendants motion to amend the petition for appeal and, in turn, the court addressed the merits of the appea l because (1) defendants request for the amendment at issue was made after defendant filed a timely notice of appeal and a timely petition for appeal; (2) the requested amendment was consistent with arguments presented at trial and did not constitute a broadening of the scope of the original assignment of error; and (3) the Commonwealth of Virginia did not articulate any prejudice that would follow from such an amendment. Whitt v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 637, 739 S.E.2d 254, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 10 0 (2013). Defect may be corrected after deadline for filing petition for appeal has passed.  Appellant, who timely files a petition for appeal, can file an amended petition for appeal, even after the deadline for filing the petition for appeal has passed, which corrects a defect under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12(c)(1); neither Va. Code Ann. § 17.1-408 nor Rule 5A:12(a) specifies that the petition for appeal must be free of all defects in order to be timely filed, and the statute and the rule do not prohibit an appellate court from considering, and where appropriate, granting, a motion to correct a defect with regard to pointing out where in the record the issue raised on appeal was preserved. Chatman v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 618, 739 S.E.2d 245, 2013 V a. App. LEXIS 98 (2013). Notice of appeal not timely.  Appellate court lacked jurisdiction over defendants appeal because his notice of appeal was untimely where he had a statutory right to challenge his convictio n by timely filing his own notice of appeal or by cross-appealing the Governments appeal, but did neither.

In any case in which an appeal has been taken to or filed with the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court in its discretion, on motion of the Court of Appeals, or on its own motion, may certify the case for review by the Supreme Court before it has been determined by the Court of Appeals. The effect of such certification shall be to transfer jurisdiction over the case to the Supreme Court for all purposes. B. Such certif ication may be made only when, in its discretion, the Supreme Court determines that: 1. The c ase is of such imperative public importance as to justify the deviation from normal appellate practice and to require prompt decision in the Supreme Court; or 2.

Assi gnments of error dismissed as improvidently granted.  Because neither of a husbands assignments of error involved a substantial constitutional question as a determinative issue or matters of significant precedent ial value, as required under subsection B of § 17.1-410, they were dismissed as improvidently granted. Schuman v. Schuman, 282 Va. 443, 717 S.E.2d 410, 2011 Va. LEXIS 215 (2011). Imposition of incarceration.  Court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider defendants appeal of her conviction for reckless driving even though the trial court suspended the jail sent ence that it imposed on defendant.

CASE NOTES Jurisdiction.  Although the Court of Appeals of Virginia lacked jurisdiction to hear a grandparents petition for appeal in that court when the grandparent was not a party in the stepparent adoption proceeding below, the Supreme Court of Virginia did have jurisdiction over the grandparents petition for appeal in the Supreme Court because the grandparent was a party in the Court of Appeals and was aggrieved by that court s ruling against the grandparent.

Commonwealth v. Harley, 256 Va. 216, 504 S.E.2d 852, 1998 Va. LEXIS 113 (1998) (decided under prior law).

The Supreme Court may formulate rules of practice and procedure for the circuit courts following consultation with the Chairmen of the House Committee for Courts of Justice and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the executive committee of the Judicial Confer ence of Virginia for courts of record. Such rules, subject to the strict construction of the provisions of § 8.01-4, which shall be the only rules of practice and procedure in the circuit courts of the Commonwealth, shall be included in the Code of Vi rginia as provided in § 8.01-3, subject to revision by the General Assembly. B. No rule sha ll hereafter be promulgated under the limitations of § 8.01-4, or otherwise which would avoid or preclude the judge before whom an accused is arraigned in criminal cases from hearing all aspects of the case on its merits, or to avoid or preclude any j udge in any case who has heard any part of the case on its merits, from hearing the case to its conclusion. However, another judge may hear portions of a case where a judge is required to disqualify himself, in cases in which a mistrial is declared, or i n cases which have been reversed on appeal, or in the event of sickness, disability or vacation of the judge. The parties to any suit, action, cause or prosecution may waive the provisions of this section. Such waiver shall be entered of record. C. In its rule s of practice and procedure for the circuit courts, the Supreme Court shall include rules relating to court decisions on any order of quarantine or isolation issued by the State Health Commissioner pursuant to Article 3.02 (§ 32.1-48.05 et seq.) of Ch apter 2 of Title 32.1 that shall ensure, to the extent possible, that such hearings are held in a manner that will protect the health and safety of individuals subject to any such order of quarantine or isolation, court personnel, counsels, witnesses, an d the general public. The rules shall also provide for expedited reviews by the Court of Appeals of decisions by any circuit court and by the Supreme Court of decisions of the Court of Appeals relating to appeals of any order of quarantine or isolation.

CASE NOTES Judge who hears one portion of case not required to hear all parts.  This section does not require that a judge hearing one portion of a case hear all parts of it. Schmidt v. Schmidt, No. 0703-90-4 (Ct. of Appeals April 30, 1991) ( decided under prior law). Section 17.1-503 did not mandate that the judge who hears a preliminary matter hear the entire case; the statute forbids a rule of the Supreme Court that would pr eclude a judge from hearing a case to its conclusion. Lynch v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 89, 570 S.E.2d 871, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 618 (2002). The practice of allowing any circuit judge to handle any probation violation does not vi olate this section as it pertains to § 8.01-4. Gurley v. Commonwealth, 34 Va. App. 166, 538 S.E.2d 361, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 836 (2000). Territorial jurisdiction distinguished from subject matter jurisdiction.  Unlike the subject matter jurisdiction described in § 17.1-513, which may not be waived, the jurisdiction described in § 19.2-239 refers to a circuit court s authority over persons, things, or occurrences located in a defined geographic area, which is properly categorized as territorial jurisdiction and may be waived by failing to timely raise the issue. Gordon v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 818, 568 S.E.2d 452, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 521 (2002). Interpretation of Supreme Court Rule s.  General assembly had empowered the Supreme Court of Virginia to promulgate the rules of practice and procedure both for circuit courts and for the Court of Appeal s of Virginia; consequently, while Va. Sup. Ct. R. pt. 5A governed the proceedings of the Court of Appeals, the provisions of Part 5A remained precisely that  rules of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the Supreme Court reviews the Court of Appeals interpretation of rules de novo. LaCava v. Commonwealth, 283 Va. 465, 722 S.E.2d 838, 2012 Va.

Some of the cases cited below were decided under prior law. This section confers potential jurisdiction upon all circuit courts. This is potential j urisdiction which, after valid service of process on the parties, gives the court active jurisdiction and empowers it to hear the case and enter a valid judgment therein. County School Bd. v. Snead, 198 Va. 100, 92 S.E.2d 497, 1956 Va. LEXIS 180 (1956). Circuit courts have original general jurisdiction in all personal and transitory actions by authority of this section, their territorial jurisdiction in such actions being coextensive with the State. James v. Powell, 154 Va. 96, 152 S.E. 539, 1930 Va. LEXIS 200 (1930). If they obtain jurisdiction of the parties.  Any court in the State would have jurisdiction of a transitory personal action under this section, if it obtained jurisdiction of the parties. Moore v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 124 Va. 628, 98 S.E. 635, 1919 Va. LEXIS 153 (1919); Stowers v. Harman, 128 Va. 229, 104 S.E. 703, 1920 Va. LEXIS 102 (1920). No loss of jurisdiction where conviction for lesser included offense.  This section provides that the circuit court has jurisdiction of all indictments for felonies. Since the defendant was indicted for a felony, the case had to be tried in the circuit court. Circuit courts do not lose jurisdiction to convict and sentence a defendant merely because the conviction turns out to be for a lesser included misdemeanor offense. Jimenez v. Commonwealth, 10 Va.

Research References. Friends Virginia Pleading and Practice (Matthew Bender). Chapter 3. Venue. § 3.10 Award of Costs and Attorneys Fee. Friend. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. The laws of costs are to be construed as remedial, and liberally and beneficially expoun ded for the sake of the remedy which they administer. Anglea v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 696 (1853), cited in Commonwealth v. McCue Exrs, 109 Va. 302, 63 S.E. 1066 (1909). Section applies to both suits an d actions.  This section applies to suits in chancery as well as to actions at law. City of Richmond v. Henrico County, 185 Va. 859, 41 S.E.2d 35, 1947 Va. LEXIS 224 (1947). The general rule is that costs lie within the discretion of a court of equity, and are p roperly awarded to the party prevailing. This rule is given statutory sanction by this section. Hylton v. Hunter, Wythe 195 (1793); Dillard v. Dillard, 77 Va. 820, 1883 Va. LEXIS 116 (1883); Adkins v. Edwards, 83 Va. 300, 2 S.E. 435, 1887 Va. LEXIS 68 (1 887); Goodloe v. Woods, 115 Va. 540, 80 S.E. 108, 1913 Va. LEXIS 68 (1913); McLean v. Hill, 185 Va. 346, 38 S.E.2d 583, 1946 Va. LEXIS 204 (1946); Safway Steel Scaffolds of Va., Inc. v. Coulter, 198 Va. 469, 94 S.E.2d 541, 1956 Va. LEXIS 231 (1956). In equity, the trial court has discretion in the award of costs; nevertheless, there has been found an abuse of that discretion if costs are not awarded in favor of the party or parties substantially prevailing. Smith v. Woodlawn Constr. Co., 235 Va. 424, 368 S.E.2d 699, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2626, 1988 Va. LEXIS 54 (1988). Such discretion must be exercised soundly and in the light of the result obtained in the litigation by the respective parties. McLean v. Hill, 185 Va. 346, 38 S.E.2d 583, 1946 Va. LEXIS 204 (1946); Safway Steel Scaffolds of Va., Inc. v. Coulter, 198 Va. 469, 94 S.E.2d 541, 1956 Va. LEXIS 231 (1956). It is considered as the exercise of sound discretion to forbid the imposition of costs on a party nowise in the wrong; and the very fact that an appeal will not l ie from the court of chancery merely on the ground that the appellant has been improperly decreed to pay costs, renders the lower courts all the more careful in the exercise of the discretion given them on this subject. In cases of doubt or great novelty the court will refuse to award costs to either party against the other, and not infrequently the result is that each party is decreed to pay his own costs. Tabb v. Boyd, 8 Va. (4 Call) 453, 1800 Va. LEXIS 51 (1800); Turner v. Turner, 17 Va. (3 Munf) 66, 1812 Va. LEXIS 13 (1812); Pennington v. Hanby, 18 Va. (4 Munf) 140, 1814 Va. LEXIS 16 (1814); Jackson v. Cutright, 19 Va. (5 Munf) 308, 1817 Va. LEXIS 4 (1817); Lewis v. Thornton, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 87, 1818 Va. LEXIS 12 (1818); Zane v. Zane, 20 Va. (6 Mun f) 406, 1819 Va. LEXIS 40 (1819); Ashby v. Kiger, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 165, 1825 Va. LEXIS 12 (1825); Farmers' Bank v. Reynolds, 25 Va. (4 Rand.) 186, 1826 Va. LEXIS 21 (1826); Jones v. Mason, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 577, 1827 Va. LEXIS 24 (1827); Beverley v. Brook e, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 187, 1847 Va. LEXIS 44 (1847); Magarity v. Shipman, 82 Va. 784, 1 S.E. 109, 1887 Va. LEXIS 146 (1887); Adkins v. Edwards, 83 Va. 300, 2 S.E. 435, 1887 Va. LEXIS 68 (1887). And a clear showing of abuse is necessary for reversal.  The action of an equity trial court in regard to costs will not be reversed except upon a clear showing of abuse. Goodloe v. Woods, 115 Va. 540, 80 S.E. 108, 1913 Va. LEXIS 68 (1913). Court costs non-dischargea ble in bankruptcy.  The fact that in some instances punishment will be contingent on court costs is sufficient, for definitional purposes, to lift Virginias requirement that conv icted defendants pay court costs into the non-dischargeability provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(7). Thompson v. Virginia, 16 F.3d 576, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 2492 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1221, 114 S. Ct. 2709, 129 L. Ed. 2d 836, 1994 U.S. LEX IS 4709 (1994). The exception of former § 14.1-181 (now § 17.1-604) relates only to costs in the Supreme Court, which are to be recovered by the party substantially prevailing. Commonwealth ex rel. State Water Control Bd. v. County Utils. Corp., 223 Va. 534, 290 S.E.2d 867, 1982 Va. LEXIS 236 (1982). Since former § 14.1-201 (now § 17.1-629) is in this chapter within the mea ning of this section, it is subject to the discretion of the chancellor in apportioning costs in an equity case in a circuit court. Commonwealth ex rel. State Water Control Bd. v. County Utils. Corp., 223 Va. 534, 290 S.E.2d 867, 1982 Va. LEXIS 236 (1982 ). Sovereign immunity is no bar to an award of costs or attorney fees in an appeal to the c ircuit court from a juvenile courts finding of no child abuse. Donald v. Fairfax County Dep't of Human Dev., 20 Va. App. 155, 455 S.E.2d 740, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 335 (1995), rev'd, 251 Va. 227, 467 S.E.2d 803, 1996 Va. LEXIS 34 (1996). Pl ea of sovereign immunity in action seeking attorney fees.  Trial court did not err in sustaining a special plea of sovereign immunity filed by a county department of social services in a fathers action seeking attorne ys fees pursuant to § 16.1-278.19 because the General Assembly did not waive the Departments sovereign immunity under §§ 17.1-600 and 17.1-629, in suits in equity where a party sought an award of costs; § 17.1-600 speaks of the court s discretion in equity, but Virginia courts did not have discretion to award attorneys fees in any case, whether legal or equitable, absent a specific grant of such authority, and because § 17.1-600 did not specifically allow the award of attorneys fees, the trial court could not award attorneys fees to the father, especially since the opposing party was the department, a government agency protected by sovereign immunity. Murphy v. Charlotte County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 57 Va. App. 784, 706 S.E.2d 546, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 97 (2011). Apportionment of costs in a judicial review procedure under § 62.1-44.29 was within the trial courts discretion, and would not be reversed except upon a clear showing of abuse. Commonwealth ex rel. State Water Control Bd. v. County Utils. Corp., 223 Va. 534, 290 S.E.2d 867, 1982 Va. LEXIS 236 (1982). When a proceeding is equitable.  The form and object of a judicial proceeding, and particularly the nature of the relief which it makes available, determine whether it is legal or equitable. The label assigned by the clerk is not controlling. Commonwealth ex rel. State Water Control Bd. v. County Utils. Corp., 223 Va. 534, 290 S.E.2d 867, 1982 Va. LEXIS 236 (1982). Reimbursement by p arents of guardian ad litem fee.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a mother to pay one-half of a guardian ad litems fee, where the evidence presented demonstrated that the guardian was appointed to protect the interests of the children and favorably addressed an issue related to the mothers successful treatment for depression. Leake v. Leake, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 491 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 12, 2004). Guardian ad litem fees appropriate.  On appeal from an award of primary physical custody of the children to the father, the mothers contention that the circuit court erred in ordering her to pay one-half of the guardian ad litems fees was improper under subsection (b) of § 20-79(b), subdivision 5 of § 20-99, and former § 14.1-177 (now this section) because, while she clearly made less money than father, she had the ability to pay on e-half the cost of the guardian ad litems fee, notwithstanding the resulting hardship and sacrifice associated with it. Gudino v. Gudino, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 1, 2011). Discretion to award guardian a d litem fees.  Mother waived her claim of error in the apportionment of guardian ad litem fees in a change in physical custody dispute as although the mother stated her objectio n in a document of objections to the final order, she did not argue or obtain a ruling from the trial court on the issue; the mother did not argue that the exceptions to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 for good cause or to meet the ends of justice applied, and the record did not reflect any reason to invoke the good cause or ends of justice exceptions since guardian ad litem fees could properly be assigned as costs to the parties under §§ 20-79(b), 20-99(5), and 17.1-600.

The cases below were decided under prior law. The allowance of costs depends entirely upon statute, no costs being allowed in any case at common law. Scott v. Doughty, 130 Va. 523, 107 S.E. 729, 1921 Va. LEXIS 170 (1921). This section applies only to costs in the trial court and not to costs in the Supreme Co urt. Scott v.

As to costs in the appellate court, it is otherwise provided in former § 14.1-181 (now § 17.1-604). Scott v. Doughty, 130 Va. 523, 107 S.E. 729, 192 1 Va. LEXIS 170 (1921). Several trials and appeals of same c ase.  Where a plaintiff obtained three verdicts and judgments in the trial court, the first two of which were set aside by the Supreme Court but the last affirmed, he i s entitled to his costs on the trials in the lower court and the last appeal, but defendant is entitled to the costs on the first two appeals. Scott v. Doughty, 130 Va. 523, 107 S.E. 729, 1921 Va. LEXIS 170 (1921). Costs incurred before joinder of par ty.  A general judgment for costs against two defendants in ejectment was held proper, though one of them did not enter himself a defendant until there had been one tr ial of the cause and a large portion of the costs had been incurred. Middleton v. Johns, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 129, 1847 Va. LEXIS 33 (1847).

Its provisions are mandatory as to judgment against the beneficial plaintiff. In re Butl er, 20 F. Supp. 995, 1937 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1520 (D. Va. 1937) (holding that, even assuming that the section was applicable in an action by administratrix under the Federal Employers Liability Act for the death of her husband, the section did not serv e to make decedents estate liable for costs against the administratrix with the result of relieving her of her personal liability for such costs.). Illustrative cases.  In a suit for an injunction to restrain defendant from hauling timber over a tract which complainant claimed to own, the trial court decreed that complainant was not entitled to the relief prayed for and dismissed the bill at the cost of the complainant and her son, whom the evidence showed to be the fee simple owner of the tract of land and who was shown to have been the instigator of the suit and to have been a ctive in prosecuting it. It was not error to decree costs against complainants son, although he was not a formal party to the suit. Ashby v. Justus, 183 Va. 555, 32 S.E.2d 709, 1945 Va. LEXIS 202 (1945). In action in name of one for use of another, it is usual to state the fact in the declaration, or on it, or on the writ. But this is not necessary. The endorsemen t may be made at any time during progress of the suit. And whether so endorsed or not, the party for whose use the suit is, if the fact appears of record, is bound for the costs under this section. Hayes v. Virginia Mut. Protection Ass'n, 76 Va. 225, 188 2 Va. LEXIS 23 (1882). Where it appears from the record that the recovery in the trial court was for the use of a designated person other than the nominal plaintiff, the Supreme Court, on reversing the judgment of the trial court, will give judgment for costs against the beneficial, and not the nominal, plaintiff in the court below. Such judgment is within the spirit, if not the letter, of this section, as well as within the control of the sound reasoning of the court, in well considered cases decided by it. Western Union Tel.

Several trials and appeals.  Where a plaintiff obtained three verdicts and judgments in the trial court, the first two of which were set aside by the Supreme Court but the last affirmed, he i s entitled to his costs on the trials in the lower court and the last appeal, but defendant is entitled to the costs on the first two appeals.

Any person who is (i) a plaintiff in a civil action in a court of the Commonwealth and a resident of the Commonwealth or (ii) a defendant in a civil action in a court of the Commonwealth, and who is on account of his poverty unable to pay fees or costs, may be allo wed by a court to sue or defend a suit therein, without paying fees or costs; whereupon he shall have, from any counsel whom the court may assign him, and from all officers, all needful services and process, without any fees, except what may be included in the costs recovered from the opposite party. B. In determin ing a persons inability to pay fees or costs on account of his poverty, the court shall consider whether such person is a current recipient of a state or federally funded public assistance program for the indigent or is represented by a legal aid soc iety, subject to § 54.1-3916, including an attorney appearing as counsel, pro bono, or assigned or referred by a legal aid society. If so, such person shall be presumed unable to pay such fees or costs. Except in the case of a no-fault divorce proceed ing under subdivision A (9) of § 20-91, such presumption shall be rebuttable where the court finds that a more thorough examination of the persons financial resources is necessary. C. If a person claims indigency but is not presumptively unable to pay under subsection B, or a court, where applicable, finds that a more thorough examination of the financial resources of the petitioner is needed, the court shall consider: 1. The n et income of such person, which shall include his total salary and wages, less deductions required by law and tax withholdings; 2. Such persons liquid assets, including all cash on hand as well as assets in checking, savings, and similar accounts; and 3. Any exceptional expenses of such person and his dependents, including costs for medical care, family support obligations, and child care payments.The available funds of the person shal l be calculated as the sum of his total income and liquid assets less exceptional expenses as provided in subdivision 3. If the available funds are equal to or less than 125 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines prescribed for the size of the household of such person by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, he shall be presumed unable to pay. The Supreme Court of Virginia shall be responsible for distributing to all courts the annual updates of the federal poverty income guidel ines made by the Department. History History.

The 2017 amendments by cc. 226 and 227 are identical, and rewrote the first sentence, which formerly read Any person, who is a resident of this Commonwealth, and on account of his poverty is unable to pay fees or costs may be allowed by a court to sue or defend a suit therein, without paying fees or costs; whereupon he shall have, from any counsel whom the court may assign him, and from all officers, all need ful services and process, without any fees, except what may be included in the costs recovered from the opposite party and added the second sentence. The 2019 amendments. The 2019 amendment by c. 411 designated the existing provisions as subsections A and B; in subsection B, added provided that, in the case of a no-fault divorc e proceeding under subdivision A (9) of § 20-91, there shall be a presumption that a person who is a current recipient of a state or federally funded public assistance program for the indigent is unable to pay in the first sentence and added the s econd sentence.

Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. Section permits indigent prisoner to proceed in forma pauperis and to have counsel appoi nted in certain circumstances. Al-Mustafa Irshad v. Spann, 543 F. Supp. 922, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13674 (E.D. Va. 1982). Not applicable on appeal.  This section does not apply to appellate proceedings. Tyler v. Garrison, 120 Va. 697, 91 S.E. 749, 1917 Va. LEXIS 152 (1917). A petition for a writ of mandamus, when properly grounded, invokes original rather than appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, in which a pauper may be allowed to sue without paying fees or costs within the meaning of this section. Greer v. Dillard, 213 Va. 477, 193 S.E.2d 668, 1973 Va. LEXIS 169 (1973). A bond is neither a fee nor a cost. Greer v. Dillard, 213 Va. 477, 193 S.E.2d 668, 1973 V a. LEXIS 169 (1973). Indigents not excused from appeal bonds.  In 1972, when the General Assembly was in the process of amending the in forma pauperis statute, it was fully aware of its interrelationship with §§ 16.1-10 6 and 16.1-107 and, had it seen fit, could have authorized indigent appeals without bonds simply by adding the word bonds in context with the words fees or costs. Its failure to do so is not to be treated as an inadvertent omission to be supplied by judicial construction. Greer v. Dillard, 213 Va. 477, 193 S.E.2d 668, 1973 Va. LEXIS 169 (1973). It is one thing for the State to excuse indigents from payment of fees and costs which are essentially state interests; it is another thing for the State to excus e indigents from posting bonds designed to protect the judgment rights of successful litigants. Greer v. Dillard, 213 Va. 477, 193 S.E.2d 668, 1973 Va. LEXIS 169 (1973). Inmates proceeding in forma pauperis.  Under this provision the courts in Virginia have the discretion to appoint counsel to represent inmates proceeding in forma pauperis. Giarratano v. Murray, 847 F. 2d 1118, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 7458 (4th Cir. 1988), rev'd, 492 U.S. 1, 109 S. Ct. 2765, 106 L. Ed. 2d 1, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 3134 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 907, 110 S. Ct. 266, 107 L. Ed. 2d 216, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 4672 (1989). Appointment of c ounsel not specifically required.  This section, which provides that in a civil action an indigent shall have, from any counsel whom the court may assign him, . . . all needful services . . ., without any fees to them therefor, does not specifically require the appointment of such counsel. Darnell v. Peyton, 208 Va. 675, 160 S.E.2d 749, 1968 Va. LEXIS 165 (1968). Petition mus t be filed and nonfrivolous claim raised.  Although such limitations do not appear on the face of the statute, appointments are made under this provision only after a petition is filed and then only if a n onfrivolous claim is raised. Giarratano v. Murray, 668 F. Supp. 511, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16315 (E.D. Va. 1986), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 836 F.2d 1421, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 3 (4th Cir. 1988). Petitioner was furnished, without cost, certified copies of the arrest warrants, indictm ent and the order of conviction at his criminal trial. McCoy v. Lankford, 210 Va. 264, 170 S.E.2d 11, 1969 Va. LEXIS 230 (1969). No p rovision for transcript in applying for habeas corpus.  No provision is made for a transcript of the evidence of the criminal trial for use in applying for habeas corpus. Hudgins v. Circuit Court, 294 F. Supp. 258, 196 8 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7989 (E.D. Va. 1968). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Petition granted.  Although the inmate was allowed to proceed in forma pauperis his motion for appointment of counsel was denied because the inmate raised issues that, at best, only tangentially affected his confinement and the court would not intervene in the discretionary decision-making of either the department of corrections or the parole board.

The security shall be by bond, payable to the Commonwealth, but there need only be one obligor therein, if he be sufficient and a resident of the Commonweal th. The court before whom, or before whose clerk, such bond is given, may, on motion by a defendant or officer, give judgment for so much as he is entitled to by virtue of such bond. History History.

Dismissal, Discontinu ance and Nonsuit, § 13. CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases below were decided under prior law. The manifest purpose of this section is to insure the payment of costs which may be awar ded against a nonresident plaintiff against whom the court has no means of enforcing a collection. Outlaw v. Pearce, 176 Va. 458, 11 S.E.2d 600, 1940 Va. LEXIS 266 (1940). This section, and its statutory ancestors were designed, not to deny nonresidents access to Virginias courts, but to insure to the defendant and to the offici als of the court the payment of costs which may be awarded against a nonresident plaintiff against whom the court has no means of enforcing a collection. Chagnon v. Hofferman, 230 Va. 176, 335 S.E.2d 268, 1985 Va. LEXIS 266 (1985). Waiver of right to require security.  Notwithstanding the fact that this section is mandatory, the right of a defendant to require a nonresident plaintiff to give security for costs may be waived by h is conduct in failing promptly to move for such security. Outlaw v. Pearce, 176 Va. 458, 11 S.E.2d 600, 1940 Va. LEXIS 266 (1940). When motion for security may be made.  It is generally held that motion to require security for costs under this section comes too late when it is made after the case is called for trial or after a ver dict has been rendered. Outlaw v. Pearce, 176 Va. 458, 11 S.E.2d 600, 1940 Va. LEXIS 266 (1940) (holding that the motion was too late when made at the time of the argument of a motion for a new trial). When security may be given.  Where an order was entered for security for costs, to be given within 60 days, and no security was entered within such time it was error to dismiss the suit for f ailure to give the security if sufficient security was offered at the time of the motion to dismiss. Goodtitle v. See, 3 Va. (1 Va. Cas.) 123 (1799). Security given after 60-day period but before dismissal.  Under this section, when a Virginia resident, named as a defendant in a suit or action brought in a Virginia court by a nonresident plaintiff, files a suggestion of nonresidency, the plaintiff is required to post a bond for costs and damages. If he fails to do so within 60 days, the statute authorizes the court to dismiss the case. The court cannot, however, exercise that authority if before the dismission . . . security be given. Chagnon v. Hofferman, 230 Va. 176, 335 S.E.2d 268, 1985 Va. LEXIS 266 (1985). Additional security; discretio n of court.  The lower court having complied with the mandatory provisions of this section, in requiring complainant, a nonresident, to give security for costs, was only bound to exercise reasonable discretion in regard to any subsequent motion for increase of the security, and where such a motion was not passed upon until after the court had decided the merits of the case adversely to the defendant, its refusal by the same d ecree which disposed of all the other questions to order additional security was reasonable and natural. Goins v. Garber, 131 Va. 59, 108 S.E. 868, 1921 Va. LEXIS 8 (1921). Proof of nonresidence.  Where plaintiff proved that his house was inside the state line and that he was living with his family there, proof that the sheriff had twice been there to serve process on him, but could not find him, did not sustain a motion under this section. Evans v. Bradshaw, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 207, 1853 Va. LEXIS 35 (1853). Effect of failure to give security.  Where, on the motion of the defendant in an attachment case, the plaintiff, who is a nonresident of the State, is ordered to give security for the costs of the su it within 60 days, and fails to do so, his bill should be dismissed; and it is error to proceed to hear and decide the cause. Anderson v. Johnson, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 558, 1879 Va. LEXIS 87 (1879) (see Outlaw v. Pearce, 176 Va. 458, 11 S.E.2d 600 (1941)). Costs in appellate court.  Even prior to the 1938 amendment to this section it was held that it did not apply to costs in the appellate court. Lambert v. Key, 14 Va. (4 Hen. &amp; M.) 484 (1810 ). But any doubt about the matter was clearly removed by the 1938 amendment which expressly limited the application of this section to the payment of costs and damages in the court in which the suit or action is instituted. Outlaw v. Pearce, 176 Va. 458, 11 S.E.2d 600, 1940 Va. LEXIS 266 (1940). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Amount to be imposed.  Trial court determined that the amount of the nonresident bond to be imposed in the claimants medical malpractice case against the health care providers shoul d be an amount that covered the costs essential for prosecution of the lawsuit, such as filing fees or charges for service of process, and imposed an amount accordingly.

Yost v. Porter, 80 Va. 855, 1885 Va. LEXIS 120 (1885) (decided under prior law).

Such costs shall include the allowances to witnesses as provided in § 17.1-612. If the party who is to pay the costs of the former tr ial fails to pay the same at or before the next term after the new trial is granted, the court may, on the motion of the opposite party, set aside the order granting it, and proceed to judgment on the verdict or award execution for the costs, whichever s eems best.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Object of section; waiver.  The object of the first sentence of this section is to make the payment of the costs of the former trial a condition precedent to a new trial, unless waived by th e opposite party. The object of the second sentence is to secure their prompt payment. Haupt v. Tebault, 94 Va. 184, 26 S.E. 406, 1897 Va. LEXIS 60 (1897). This section applies only to costs in the trial court, and not to costs in the Supreme C ourt incurred upon a writ of error. Southern Ry. v. Hansbrough, 107 Va. 733, 60 S.E. 58, 1908 Va. LEXIS 134 (1908). The burden of paying the costs applies only to the party to whom the new trial is granted, and not to one who is forced to submit to a new trial because a verdict in his favor has been set aside at the instance of his adversary. Southern Ry. v. Hansbrough, 107 Va. 733, 60 S.E. 58, 1908 Va. LEXIS 134 (1908). When costs may be paid or tendered.  If the costs of the former trial are paid before the new trial is had, that satisfies the requirements of this section. Lemons v. Harris, 115 Va. 809, 80 S.E. 740 , 1914 Va. LEXIS 134 (1914). Where a new trial has been granted upon condition of paying the costs of the former trial, as provided by this section, it is sufficient if the costs are paid or tendered at any time before the order granting the new trial has been set aside, and after such tender or payment it is error to rescind the order for the new trial. Haupt v. Tebault, 94 Va. 184, 26 S.E. 406, 1897 Va. LEXIS 60 (1897). Time for making objection.  If the costs have not been paid as required by this section, and the opposite party does not move the court to set aside the order granting the new trial and rend er judgment upon the verdict, but proceeds with the new trial, he will not be heard afterwards to object in the trial court, or in an appellate court, that the costs of the former trial have not been paid. Central Land Co. v. Obenchain, 92 Va. 130, 22 S. E. 876, 1895 Va. LEXIS 96 (1895). After a second trial, a plaintiff cannot for the first time object that the order granting the new trial did not require, as a condition precedent, the payment of the costs of the former trial.

CASE NOTES Review of Virginia Judicial Inquiry and Review Commissions findings.  Supreme Court of Virginia does not give due weight to the Virginia Judicial Inquiry and Review Commissions findings or their credibility determinations, inste ad, the court will accord the Commissions findings only such weight, if any, as the court deems appropriate in each case. This is so because the Commissions function is only to determine whether the charges are well-founded, and sufficient to con stitute the basis for retirement, censure, or removal of a judge, thus resulting in a complaint being filed in the court. Judicial Inquiry &amp; Review Comm'n of Va. v. Peatross, 269 Va. 428, 611 S.E.2d 392, 2005 Va. LEXIS 44 (2005). While the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission, Virginia, believed that it had grounds to file a complaint in the Supreme Court of Virginia, pursuant to Va. Con st., Art. VI, § 10, and § 17.1-902, against a district judge who was found to have violated the Canons of Judicial Conduct, the Commission was not required to do so. Under Va. Const., Art. VI, § 10, and § 17.1-902, the provisions of Va. Jud. Inq. and Rev. R. 15(A)(2), which allowed a complaint to be filed, were necessarily permissive rather than mandatory. Judicial Inquiry &amp; Review Comm'n of Va. v. Elliott, 272 Va. 97, 630 S.E.2d 485, 2006 Va. LEXIS 58 (2006). State Supreme Court had original jurisdiction over judicial inquiry proceedings and could determine based on the evidence presented that the trial judge had viola ted the Canons of Judicial Conduct. Judicial Inquiry &amp; Review Comm'n v. Shull, 274 Va. 657, 651 S.E.2d 648, 2007 Va. LEXIS 123 (2007). In a case brought pursuant to Va. Const., Art. VI, § 10 and § 17.1-902 in which the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission proved by clear and convincing ev idence that a judge violated Canons of Judicial Conduct 1, 2A, and 3B(2) when she ruled that her order denying a juveniles written motion for bond and release pending the sentencing hearing was interlocutory and nonappealable, the judge unsuccessfull y argued that the Canons were unconstitutionally vague and without appropriately definite standards as applied to the facts in the complaint against her, and that vague and indefinite laws and regulations offended due process rights.

The judge could not prevent the appeal of her decision by ruling that the order was interlocutory and nonappealable; the judges violations of Canons 1, 2A, and 3B(2) constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.

Supervision agreement.  Despite the claims of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission that the terms discussed in a judges disciplinary hearings had not yet been approved and were never reduced to a formal supervision agreement, the Commission had no right to file a complaint against the judge in the Supreme Court of Virginia pursuant to Va. Const., Art. VI, § 10, and § 17.1-902. While the judge accepted the Commissions terms in writing, the agreement was not in writing, nothing required it to be in writing, and a valid supervision agreement had been reached; the Commissions concerns that it would not sign an agreement until its chairman and members had approved th e document reflected concerns of form rather than substance, and the Court was not inclined to place form over substance. Judicial Inquiry &amp; Review Comm'n of Va. v. Elliott, 272 Va. 97, 630 S.E.2d 485, 2006 Va. LEXIS 58 (2006). A statement was made that the terms would be reduced to writing, but the Chairman also indicated that the judge could inform others that he would return to the be nch; thus, no gag order was imposed, the judges statements to others that everything would be OK did not constitute a breach of the agreement, and he made no representation that the Commission had exonerated him or vindicated him.

Section tested against most exacting scrutiny since it restricts speech.  Because this section restricts speech on the basis of its content, it must be tested against the most exacting scrutiny. To withstand this scrutiny, the Commissi on must demonstrate that the confidentiality provision is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end. Baugh v. Judicial Inquiry &amp; Review Comm'n, 907 F.2d 440, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 11031 (4th Cir. 1990 ) (remanding for further development of the record on challenge to the constitutionality of this section). This section does not constitute a prior restraint or attempt by the State to censor the news media. Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 98 S. Ct. 1535, 56 L. Ed. 2d 1, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 84 (1978). Applicability. By law, records of proceedings before the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission were kept confidential; the mandamus filed by the judge was not a formal complain t filed with the Virginia Supreme Court, and the mandate of confidentiality applied. In re Bennett, 301 Va. 68, 871 S.E.2d 445, 2022 Va. LEXIS 27 (2022). The First Amendment does not permit the criminal punishment of third persons who are strangers to the inquiry for divulging or publishing truthful information regarding confidential proceedings of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission. Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 98 S. Ct. 1535, 56 L. Ed. 2d 1, 1978 U.S. L EXIS 84 (1978). Neither the Commonwealths interest in protecting the reputation of its judges, nor in maintaining the institutional integrity of its courts is sufficient to j ustify the subsequent punishment of speech of third persons who are strangers to the inquiry divulging truthful information regarding the confidential proceedings of the Commission. Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 98 S. Ct. 1535, 56 L. Ed. 2d 1, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 84 (1978). The risk of injury to the judge under inquiry, to the system of justice, or to the operation of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission, created by the divulgi ng by third persons of truthful information regarding the confidential proceedings of the Commission falls short of a clear and present danger to the orderly administration of justice. Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 98 S. Ct. 15 35, 56 L. Ed. 2d 1, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 84 (1978). Strangers include news media.  See Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 98 S. Ct. 1535, 56 L. Ed. 2d 1, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 84 (1978). Required proof of clear and pr esent danger.  Proof by actual facts of the existence of a clear and present danger to the orderly administration of justice is required before a determination can be ma de of whether conduct charged falls within the reach of this section and if so whether the legislation is consonant with the First Amendment. Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 98 S. Ct. 1535, 56 L. Ed. 2d 1, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 84 (197 8). Waiver of objection to admission.  In a case brought by the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission (Commission) pursuant to Va. Const., Art. VI, § 10 and § 17.1-902, citing to § 17.1-913, the judge unsuccessfully argued that it was improper for the Commission to admit and consider evidence of her prior contacts with the Commission; she contended that neither § 17.1-913 nor VA. Jud. Inq. and Rev. R. 16 allowed for the removal of the con fidentiality of records of complaints that were not deemed well founded and that her two prior contacts were not determined to be well founded. At the outset of the Commission hearing, counsel for the Commission stated that the exhibits were all in the r ed binder there on the witness desk and that both the sides were in agreement that there was no objection to the admission of any of the exhibits; pursuant to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5:25, the judges agreement to the Commissions admission of the exhibits was fatal to her argument that the Commission erred in admitting those same exhibits.
