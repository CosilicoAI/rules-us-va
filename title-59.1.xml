CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS State action doctrine inapplicable.  Citys demurrer to a county water authoritys complaint alleging monopolization and attempted monopolization in violation of the Virginia Antitrust Act was overruled because the state action doctrine did not immunize the city from liability under the Act; nothing in the statutory provisions the parties cited authorized the city to engage in anti-competitive behavior in the provision of municipal utility ser vices in a neighboring municipality, without first obtaining the consent of the neighboring municipality.

Ed. 315 (1943) state action immunity which foreclosed liability under the federal anti-trust act forecloses liability under the state antitrust act. Moreover, the Virginia Antitrust Act excludes any activity which is authorized by a Virginia statute. Reasor v. City of Norfolk, 606 F. Supp. 788, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14878 (E.D. Va. 1984). Rule of reason most prudent course absent precedent.  Where the court cannot find any cases that have dealt with the type of restraints being challenged, the most prudent course for the court to take is to apply the rule of reason.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Home Solicitation Sale.  Defendants demurrer was sustained because plaintiff did not state sufficient facts to support a violation of the Virginia Home Solicitation Sales Act because she failed to sufficiently allege a home solicitation sale as defendant came to plaintiffs residence at her request to conduct home repair services; and her complaint failed to allege that she agreed to purchase services from defendant when its repre sentative first visited her at her home because the contract for specific services was typed, indicating that it likely was not completed at the time of the initial visit, and the contract was dated almost two months before plaintiffs dated signature , further proof that she probably did not execute the agreement during the home visit. Theuer v. Norfolk Air Heating &amp; Cooling, Inc., 106 Va. Cir. 113, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 190 (Norfolk Oct. 7, 2020). § 59.1-21.3. Cancellation of sale.

CASE NOTES Sufficient evidence for conviction.  More than sufficient evidence existed to prove that defendant knowingly possessed illegally reproduced videocassettes for sale, in violation of § 59.1-41.3, wh ere the evidence presented at trial proved that defendant accepted, paid for, and transported two packages known by police officers to contain pirated CDs and videocassettes and defendant had a price list in his wallet titled the Underground Wholesal e Price List. Milteer v.

The term manufacturer shall not include the manufacturer of the cartridge or casing itself. The term recorded device means the tangible medium upon which sounds or images are recorded or otherwise stored, and includes any phonograph record, disc, wire, tape, videocassette, film or other medium now known or later developed on which sounds or images are recorded or otherwise stored.

CASE NOTES Separate indictment sh ould have been stricken.  Where defendant was charged separately for violating § 59.1-41.3 and § 59.1-41.4, for possessing videocassettes and CDs for the purpose of selling, manufact uring, distributing, or acquiring them without their true names and addresses of their manufacturers, the trial court erred in failing to strike the indictment on the CD charge, namely § 59.1-41.4, because the acts charged under § 59.1-41.4, standi ng alone, did not constitute a crime as neither the indictment nor the conviction order cited a violation of § 59.1-41.3, which conviction under § 59.1-41.4 depended upon. Milteer v. Commonwealth, 267 Va. 732, 595 S.E.2d 275, 2004 Va. LEXIS 69 (200 4). Suppression of evidence.  Trial courts denial of defendants motion to suppress was error and, thus, the finding that defendant was guilty of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute had to be reversed; police did not have probable cause to seize CDs found in defendants car, pursuant to §§ 59.1-41.5 and 59.1-41.4, since the items they thought were bogus CDs could have been legitimate, homemade CDs, and, thus, sin ce the search for more CDs in his car led to the discovery of marijuana, the motion to suppress the marijuana evidence should have been granted because the seizure of that evidence was not reasonable given the lack of probable cause to search. McLaughlin v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 243, 629 S.E.2d 724, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 218 (2006). § 59.1-41.5. Confiscation of nonconforming recorded devices. Text Ninety days after July 1, 1972, it shall be the duty of all law-enforcement officers, upon discovery, to confiscate all recorded devices that do not conform to the prov isions of § 59.1-41.4. The nonconforming recorded devices shall be delivered to the attorney for the Commonwealth of the county in which the confiscation was made. The attorney for the Commonwealth by court order may give the same to a charitable or e ducational organization.

McMillion v. Dryvit Sys., 262 Va. 463, 552 S.E.2d 364, 2001 Va. LEXIS 110 (2001). Action to recover false ad vertising damages.  Plaintiff car dealerships former owners claim under § 8.01-221 against defendants, a car manufacturer and its financing division, failed to state a cla im as § 8.01-221 did not create a separate private action for the alleged Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act claims predicate acts, and while § 59.1-68.3 provided private actions for false advertising under §§ 18.2-216 and 18.2-217, there were no allegations on the nature of such advertising, and an executives alleged false credentials in a resume was insufficient.

Damages not alleged.  Summary judgment under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:18 [see now Rule 3:20] for a developer was affirmed as to two condominium owners false advertising claims under § 59.1-68.3, even assuming that the developer made untrue, deceptive, and misleading statements in advertising, that the owners were induced to purchase their units, and that they would not have done so in the absence of the inducement; there was no basis to conclude that the owners suffered a loss since they sold their units in a known defective condition at a profit. Klaiber v. Freemason Assocs., 266 Va. 478, 587 S.E.2d 555, 2003 Va. LEXIS 98 (2003). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Action to recover false ad vertising damages.  Home purchasers adequately alleged that the development corporation and other defendants involved in the building of the home purchasers home published, disse minated, and circulated before the public and potential consumers, including the home purchasers, written advertising information which falsely represented their expertise in design and construction, with the intent to sell and to offer their services as an architectural and construction firm to the public; thus, the development corporations demurrer had to be denied.

Beach Rehab Specialists, Inc. v. Augustine Med., Inc., 58 Va. Cir. 379, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 155 (Norfolk Mar. 19, 2002). Standing.  Because they suffered no loss, former owners of condominium units lacked standing to bring a claim under § 59.1-68.3 of the Condominium Act, this count was dis missed on summary judgment. 313 Freemason v. Freemason Assocs., 59 Va. Cir. 407, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 365 (Norfolk Aug. 30, 2002). Statute of limitations.  Claim for deceptive advertising, under § 59.1-68.3, by a condominium association against a manufacturer of an allegedly defective exterior insulation finishing system was barred by the two-year statute of limitations of § 8.01-248, under the statutes catch-all provision; the time that plaintiffs suffered loss was not upon the discovery of the finishing system related damage, as the date of loss occurred either when the finishing system was chosen by the builders or when the system was installed, pursuant to § 8.01-230.

In re Miller, 218 Va. 939, 243 S.E.2d 464, 1978 Va. LEXIS 250 (1978) (decided under former § 8-577.1). The object of this chapter is to protect the public by giving information as to the pers on with which it deals and to afford it protection against possible fraud and deceit. Tate v. Atlanta Oak Flooring Co., 179 Va. 365, 18 S.E.2d 903, 1942 Va. LEXIS 230 (1942). The main object of the statute is to prevent fraud and to compel an individual or a corporation to disclose the name of the real owner of the business, in order t hat the person or corporation may sue in or be sued by the proper name. There is a further reason for the enactment of the statute and that is that prospective creditors of the firm or corporation may, by an examination of the lien dockets, determine to whom credit can be extended. Judgments are docketed in the true name of the plaintiff and defendant, and all that is required of an examiner of the lien docket, in order to ascertain against whom a judgment is docketed, is to look for the name of the per son or corporation under investigation. Leckie v. Seal, 161 Va. 215, 170 S.E. 844, 1933 Va. LEXIS 313 (1933) (see Colbert v. Ashland Constr. Co., 176 Va. 500, 11 S.E.2d 612 (1940)). The purpose of this section is to prevent fraud and to compel an individual or a corporation to disclose the name of the real owner of the business, in order that the person or corporation may sue in or be sued by the proper name. Bryant Elec. Co. v. Joe Rainero Tile Co., 84 F.R.D. 120, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8908 (W.D. Va. 1979). And it is to be strictly construed.  This chapter is to be strictly construed, bearing in mind its intent and purpose. Tate v. Atlanta Oak Flooring Co., 179 Va. 365, 18 S.E.2d 903, 1942 Va. LEXIS 230 (1942). But see Colbert v. Ashland Constr. Co., 176 Va. 500, 11 S.E.2d 612, 1940 Va. LEXIS 269 (1940) (holding that the chapter should be liberally construed). Name not within chapter.  Where the designation under which a business is being conducted consists of the surname of the proprietor or proprietors, with the addition of the words and C ompany or &amp; Co., preceded by a word descriptive of the nature of the business, the name is no t within this chapter. Tate v. Atlanta Oak Flooring Co., 179 Va. 365, 18 S.E.2d 903, 1942 Va. LEXIS 230 (1942) (holding that this section did not apply where trade name was A. E. Tate Lumber Company and A. E. Tate was the sole owner) (see also Ma tthews v. Barfield, 179 Va. 691, 20 S.E.2d 497 (1942)). Judgment against fictiti ous person not a lien.  No language is embodied in the chapter which even tends to support the proposition that it was the intention of the legislature that a judgment obtained against a fictitious person or corporation as such, should be a lien upon the property of the true owner. Leckie v. Seal, 161 Va. 215, 170 S.E. 844, 1933 Va. LEXIS 313 (1933). Amendment of complaint in diversity action upon discovery of proper name.  Where, because of defendant corporations failure to comply with this section, plaintiff in a diversity action in federal court was unable to ascertain the cor rect name of the corporation, and therefore was placed in the position of naming in his complaint the person who was apparently in charge of the business, plaintiff properly amended his complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 (a) prior to responsive pleading by the defendant upon discovering the proper name of the defendant. Bryant Elec. Co. v. Joe Rainero Tile Co., 84 F.R.D. 120, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8908 (W.D. Va. 1979). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Failure to file certificate of fictitious name use.  Defendants motion for summary judgment was granted, which asserted it was not the proper defendant, because plaintiffs negligence complaint suing Jeff Rorer, d/b/a Mostly Sofas when it should have sued Faith, Inc. was more than a misnomer and was not amendable under § 8.01-6, because the businesses were separate entities. Amendment was further precluded because neither the originall y named defendant, nor the correct defendant, was served within the applicable statute of limitations period, thus, it did not matter that Mostly Sofas never filed a certificate identifying itself as a fictitious name. Bryant v. Rorer, 66 Va. Cir. 226, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 353 (Roanoke Nov. 19, 2004). Trial court granted the claimants motion to amend the named party; due to the named corporations failure to file a fictitious name report in Virginias public records, the claimants efforts to discover the correct entity behind the name and address of the true operator of the hotel where the claimant allegedly was injured yielded only the named corporation and its registered agent for service of pr ocess, which was the information that the claimant used. Roper v. FCGMI, Inc., 72 Va. Cir. 135, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 212 (Fairfax County Oct. 4, 2006). Because the correct operating entity of a hotel never filed the fictitious name certificate required by § 59.1-69, and because there was no way that the plaint iff could ever have learned the correct name, the entitys failure amounted to concealment that estopped it from claiming that service on its registered agent was untimely under § 8.01-6. Roper v. Fcgmi, Inc., 72 Va. Cir. 135, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 6 (Fairfax County Jan. 2, 2007). When a law firm sued a car dealership for negligence regarding a vehicle that was titled in an unregistered fictitious name, the firms failure to register the fictitious name before titling the car did not bar the suit because the non-compliance with § 59.1-69 was eliminated when the firm later registered the fictitious name, after which any bar imposed by § 59.1-76 was removed. Ferris Law Offices, P.C. v. Sonic-Manhattan Fairfax, Inc., 81 Va. Cir. 283, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 113 (Fairfax County Oct. 21, 2010). Standing.  When a law firm sued a car dealership for negligence regarding a vehicle that was titled in an unregistered fictitious name, the firm did not lack standing becaus e: (1) the firms failure to register the name before titling the car did not show the firm was a separate entity from the name, as, under §§ 59.1-69 and 59.1-76, an unregistered fictitious name was not automatically a separate entity from the u nderlying corporation; (2) these provisions did not void acts taken under an unregistered fictitious name; and (3) the names registration cured any non-registration issue.

CASE NOTES This section is remedial and is to be construed liberally to the end that a litigant may have his day in court, provided he complies with the provisions of the chapter. Phlegar v. Virginia Foods, Inc., 188 Va. 747, 51 S.E.2d 227, 1949 Va. LEXIS 244 (1949). It accomplishes two purposes. It removes the taint of illegality from the cause of actio n, and it gives the suitor the right to maintain the action after he has complied with the requirements of the chapter. Phlegar v. Virginia Foods, Inc., 188 Va. 747, 51 S.E.2d 227, 1949 Va. LEXIS 244 (1949). And does not render the cause of action illegal.  As amended in 1942, by the addition of this section, this chapter does not render the cause of action illegal. It is not the right to begin the action, but the ri ght to maintain it, that is withheld for failure to comply with its terms. It takes no right away from the offending party after compliance. When its terms are met, the barriers theretofore existing are removed. Phlegar v. Virginia Foods, Inc., 188 Va. 7 47, 51 S.E.2d 227, 1949 Va. LEXIS 244 (1949). Filing certificate prior t o bringing action.  Under this section, whenever it appears that the principal creditor or his assignee has filed a certificate pursuant to the provisions of this chapter prior to th e bringing of the action, then he is entitled to recover, if the law and the facts be with him. Watkins v. Bishop, 181 Va. 191, 24 S.E.2d 422, 1943 Va. LEXIS 167 (1943). Or at any time before final judgment.  While the case of Bain v. Boykin, 180 Va. 259, 23 S.E.2d 127 (1942), was pending in the Supreme Court, the General Assembly amended the act from which this chapter was derived, in effect overruling the decision in Colbert v. Ashland Constr. Co., 176 Va. 500, 11 S.E.2d 612 (1940), and expressly providing that failure to comply with the provisions of the act should not co nstitute a bar to the action if such certificate was filed at any time before final judgment. City of Norfolk v. Stephenson, 185 Va. 305, 38 S.E.2d 570, 1946 Va. LEXIS 201 (1946). Compliance with the chapter after defendants filed pleas of the general issue was suffic ient. Phlegar v. Virginia Foods, Inc., 188 Va. 747, 51 S.E.2d 227, 1949 Va. LEXIS 244 (1949). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Failure to file as it relates to statute of limitations.  Defendants motion for summary judgment was granted, which asserted it was not the proper defendant, because plaintiffs negligence complaint suing Jeff Rorer, d/b/a Mostly Sofas when it should have sued Faith, Inc. was more than a misnomer and was not amendable under § 8.01-6, because the businesses were separate entities. Amendment was further precluded because neither the originall y named defendant, nor the correct defendant, was served within the applicable statute of limitations period, thus, it did not matter that Mostly Sofas never filed a certificate identifying itself as a fictitious name. Bryant v. Rorer, 66 Va. Cir. 226, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 353 (Roanoke Nov. 19, 2004). Registration to do business in Virginia was not condition precedent to maintaining a lawsuit.  See Geographic Network Affiliates-Int'l, Inc. v. Enter. for Empowerment Found., 68 Va. Cir. 185, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 237 (Norfolk June 27, 2005). Standing d espite failure to register fictitious name.  When a law firm sued a car dealership for negligence regarding a vehicle that was titled in an unregistered fictitious name, the firms failure to register the fictitious name before titling the car did not bar the suit because the non-compliance with § 59.1-69 was eliminated when the firm later registered the fictitious name, after which any bar imposed by § 59.1-76 was removed. Ferris Law Offices, P.C. v. Sonic-Manhattan Fairfax, Inc., 81 Va. Cir. 283, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 113 (Fairfax County Oct. 21, 2010). When a law firm sued a car dealership for negligence regarding a vehicle that was titled in an unregistered fictitious name, the firm did not lack standing becaus e: (1) the firms failure to register the name before titling the car did not show the firm was a separate entity from the name, as, under §§ 59.1-69 and 59.1-76, an unregistered fictitious name was not automatically a separate entity from the u nderlying corporation; (2) these provisions did not void acts taken under an unregistered fictitious name; and (3) the names registration cured any non-registration issue. Ferris Law Offices, P.C. v. Sonic-Manhattan Fairfax, Inc., 81 Va. Cir. 283, 20 10 Va. Cir. LEXIS 113 (Fairfax County Oct. 21, 2010). Although the HOT lanes operator had not filed a fictitious name certificate before filing a complaint against defendant for failing to pay tolls and imposing civi l penalties, it had subsequently filed the certificate as required by § 59.1-76, and thus, defendants motion to dismiss was denied.

Text A mark by which the goods or services of any applicant for registration may be distinguished from the goods or services of others shall not be registered if it consists of or comprises: 1. Any i mmoral, deceptive or scandalous matter; 2. Any matter which may falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt or disrepute; 3.

A mark which so resembles a mark registered in this Commonwealth or a trademark, service mark or trade name previously used in this Commonwealth by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods or services of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive. History History. 1998, c. 819. Annotations CASE NOTES Actual use.  Although both the Georgia and Virginia Southern Christian Leadership Conferences (SCLC) operated in Virginia without proper authority under § 13.1-757, the Bre akaway SCLCs registration of the service/trademarks did not defeat their continuous common law use of the contested marks under subdivision 6 of this section; therefore, the trial courts judgment that the Georgia SCLC and Virginia SCLC had a supe rior claim to the marks was not erroneous.

Williams v. White, 412 Bankr. 860, 2009 Bankr. LEXIS 2385 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2009). Failure to raise genuine dispute.  District court properly granted summary judgment to a service contractor on a consumers counterclaims under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act because the c onsumers evidence was insufficient to raise a genuine dispute regarding agency where no reasonable jury could find that an automobile dealer had apparent authority to represent that the consumers vehicle was covered by the service contractors service program where the contractors notice bluntly stated that the vehicle was ineligible, and the consumers proposed counterclaims failed to meet the particularity requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Wynn's Extended Care, In c. v. Bradley, 619 Fed. Appx. 216, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 13078 (4th Cir. 2015). Standing.  In a service mark infringement case seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief in which count IV of the complaint alleged a violation of § 59.1-200 and the alleged infringer argued that the holders lacked standing to prosecute that claim, while the Supreme Court of Virginia had never squarely addressed the issue, the limiting language of § 59.1-196 and interpretative federal cases appeared to suppor t the position that the Virginia Consumer Protection Act was limited to consumer transactions. Diamonds Direct USA, Inc. v. BFJ Holdings, Inc., No. 3:12CV303-HEH, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90222 (E.D. Va. June 28, 2012). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  Virginia Consumer Protection Act, § 59.1-196 et seq., does not apply to a sale of a condominium unit. Millisor v. Anchor Point Ventures, L.L.C., 77 Va. Cir. 24 6, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 278 (Hopewell Nov. 7, 2008). Realty companys demurrer was sustained in homeowners action alleging violations of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, § 59.1-196 et seq., because th e Virginia Consumer Protection Act did not apply; the company did not sell or use defective drywall, and its only involvement was as a sellers agent, offering the completed dwelling house for sale on behalf of its principal, the owner. Seeman v. Oxfo rdshire, LLC, 83 Va. Cir. 442, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 126 (Suffolk Oct. 12, 2011). Suppliers demurrer was sustained in homeowners action alleging violations of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, § 59.1-196 et seq., because the Virg inia Consumer Protection Act did not apply; the suppliers transactions in the case involved non-consumer goods, not subject to the Act. Seeman v. Oxfordshire, LLC, 83 Va. Cir. 442, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 126 (Suffolk Oct. 12, 2011). When buyers sued sellers for fraud in a real estate sale, it was not error to apply the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, § 59.1-196 et seq., to double damages because (1) the evidence showed a seller was a supplier, (2) fraud vitiated the contract, and (3) the Virginia Real Estate Property Disclosure Act, § 55-519, did not preempt the fraud claim. Buki v. Devine, 88 Va. Cir. 1, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 143 (Northumberland County Mar. 8, 2013), modified, 88 Va. Cir. 1, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 144 (Northumberland County Aug. 23, 2013). In a wrongful death action in which the decedent died of fungal meningitis caused by an epidural injection of a contaminated steroid, the Virginia Consumer Protec tion Act applied to the aspect of the transaction at issue. None of the statutes or regulations invoked by defendants authorized a relevant aspect of the transaction in this case. Wingate v. Insight Health Corp., 87 Va. Cir. 227, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 105 (Roanoke Oct. 31, 2013). Construction.  Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, finds the General Assembly created no gap in the statutory scheme where lenders engaging in fraud may operate with impu nity, subject neither to regulatory supervision nor the disciplining balm of adjudication of a Virginia Consumer Protection Act claims in the courts; there is no gap in Virginia law through which fraudulent actors may operate in a wild west loan environment, unfettered from regulatory supervision or court enforcement. Commonwealth v. NC Fin. Solutions of Utah, LLC, 100 Va. Cir. 232, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 602 (Fairfax County Oct. 28, 2018). Stating a Virginia Consumer Protection Act claim.  Although it was unlawful pursuant to the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA), § 59.1-196 et seq., to misrepresent the source, sponsorship, approval, or cer tification of goods or services, or misrepresent that goods or services had certain quantities, characteristics, ingredients, uses, or benefits, the home purchasers failed to state a cause of action pursuant to the VCPA for such misrepresentations, as th ey did not allege a misrepresentation of material fact in their action against various defendants regarding the construction of their new home. Weiss v. Cassidy Dev. Corp., 63 Va. Cir. 76, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 183 (Fairfax County Aug. 18, 2003). Car dealers demurrer to a buyers claim under the Virginia Consumer Protection Law (Lemon Law), § 59.1-196 et seq., claim was overruled as the buyer ple d fraudulent concealment and recounted allegedly false statements made by a salesman; the phrase should have known, occurred only along with alternative language suggesting that the dealer was conscious of the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation s. The conclusion that the buyer stated a claim under § 59.1-196 was bolstered by the fact that § 59.1-207 explicitly reserved remedies for individuals aggrieved as a result of an unintentional violation. Sykes v. Brady-Bushey Ford, Inc., 69 Va. Ci r. 219, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 323 (Charlottesville Oct. 27, 2005).

History History. 1977, c. 635. Annotations CASE NOTES Reach of Act.  The Consumer Protection Act does not, in express terms, articulate a public policy, nor does it protect the welfare of the people in general; thus employees c laim that he was terminated after he complained of companys failure to disclose certain product information is beyond the reach of the limited public policy exception to Virginias common-law employment-at-will doctrine. Leverton v. AlliedSignal, Inc., 991 F. Supp. 486, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 355 (E.D. Va. 1998). Burden of proof.  Circuit court erred by instructing the jury that a buyer was required to prove her claims under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA) by clear and convincin g evidence because the VCPA created a new, statutory cause of action in addition to common-law fraud, the legislature expressly directed that the VCPA be applied as remedial legislation, and that language supported a conclusion that the legislature inten ded that courts apply the lower, preponderance standard. Ballagh v. Fauber Enters., 290 Va. 120, 773 S.E.2d 366, 2015 Va. LEXIS 80 (2015). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction.  Defendant argued that § 59.1-197 requires that a Virginia Consumer Protection Act claim must be made against a consumer/producer, but a plain reading of the st atute does no such thing; the controlling statute was § 59.1-200, and as plaintiffs complaint was essentially a verbatim recitation of prohibited practices under that statute, defendants demurrer on this ground was overruled. Futrell v. POS Au to Sales, LLC, 100 Va. Cir. 1, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 309 (Spotsylvania County Sept. 4, 2018). Particularity of claim.  Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA) claim does not need to be alleged with the same particularity as common-law fraud because a VCPA claim need only be proven to the ordinary preponderance of the evidence standard; a cause of action for fraud had different elements of proof from a VCPA claim; and increasing the burden on a consumer to bring a VCPA claim by imposing a common law pleading requirement would be c ontrary to the statutory purpose to expand the remedies afforded to consumers and to relax the restrictions imposed upon them by the common law. West v. Christopher Consultants, 106 Va. Cir. 6, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 82 (Loudoun County June 10, 2020). Pleading insufficient to state cause of action.  Court sustained the demurrer to Count IX alleging a violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA) as the VCPA did not apply to the engineering work of the engineering firm and the engineers because a consumer had to be an actual party to a transaction; and plaintiffs never bought goods or services from the engineering firm and the engineers or any person downstream of their engineering work performed f or the homeowners association.

Where car dealer moved to dismiss car buyers Virginia Consumer Protection Act claim, even though dealer was remote seller, buyers purchase was still consu mer transaction, and buyer sufficiently alleged fraud claim. Alexander v. Southeastern Wholesale Corp., 978 F. Supp. 2d 615, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149693 (E.D. Va. 2013). Consumer purpose not found.  Corporation lacked standing to bring suit under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act where the corporation was not engaged in a consumer transaction because the c orporation was not purchasing certificates of authenticity for a consumer purpose as intended by the act because (1) the corporation was not purchasing the certificates of authenticity to use for a personal, family, or household purpose, (2) rather, the purchases were made for investigatory purposes, namely to determine whether defendants were engaging in the sale of certificates of authenticity without the required software, and (3) the corporations purchases were made on its own behalf, not on beh alf of potential consumers of its software. Microsoft Corp. v. # 9 Software, Inc., No. 4:05cv106, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36710 (E.D. Va. Dec. 15, 2005). Scope of protection.  Borrowers lacked any possibility of establishing a Virginia Consumer Protection Act claim because appointment of defendant as substitute trustee was valid under V irginia law and the borrowers had not alleged that defendant owed them fiduciary duties under the terms of the deed of trust. McFadden v. Fannie Mae, 525 Fed. Appx. 223, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 10067 (4th Cir. 2013). Person.  Where plaintiff was a Washington corporation, it was clear that plaintiff was a person within the meaning of § 59.1-198.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  No matter if by definition or by preemption, the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA) does not apply to legal services; therefore, a client was unable to pursu e a claim under the VCPA based on legal representation that he received.

Acts 1999, c. 494, cl. 3 which had provided that the provisions of c. 494 would expire July 1, 2000, was repealed by Acts 2000, cc. 691 and 706, cl. 3. In subsection D, § 6.2-1600 was substituted for § 6.1-409, effective October 1, 2010, to conform to the recodification of Title 6.1 by Acts 2010, c. 794. To conform to the recodification of Title 55 by Acts 2019, c. 712, effective October 1, 2019, the following substitution was made at the direction of the Virginia Code Commission: substituted the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (§ 55.1-1200 et seq.) or Chapter 14 (§ 55.1-1400 et seq.) of Title 55.1 for the Landlord and Tenant Act, Chapter 13 (§ 55-217 et seq.) of Title 55 or the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, Chapter 13.2 (§ 55-248.2 et seq.) of Title 55. CASE NOTES Consumer real estate transactions.  Under 15 U.S.C. § 1603, consumer real estate transactions are covered by the Federal Consumer Protection Act. Therefore, the Virginia Consumer Protection Act i s inapplicable. Smith v. United States Credit Corp., 626 F. Supp. 102, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14128 (E.D. Va. 1985), aff'd, Smith v. Anderson, 801 F.2d 661, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 30850 (4th Cir. 1986). Creditors failure to timely release a lien against a consumers residence after the underlying debt obligation was satisfied did not violate consumer prote ction statute since the loan was a mortgage loan which created the lien against the consumers residence, even though the loan proceeds were used to purchase a vehicle. Poindexter v. Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp., 792 F.3d 406, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 11650 (4th Cir. 2015). Misrepresentatio ns by banks and mortgage lenders.  Virginia Consumer Protection Act, pursuant to subsection D of § 59.1-199, did not apply to alleged misrepresentations by banks and mortgage lenders. Feeley v. Total Realty Mgmt., 660 F. Supp. 2d 700, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125149 (E.D. Va. 2009). Insurance company has right to subrogation under Virginia Consumer Protection Act.  Both Virginia common and statutory law provide for an insurance companys right to subrogation where the insureds loss allegedly was caused by a third part ys negligent or tortious conduct. Subsection D, while exempting insurance companies from suit under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, is silent with respect to subrogation rights. Consequently, the act should not serve to nullify the Virginia com mon and statutory law permitting an insurance company a right to subrogation, in the absence of any express indication from the Virginia legislature that such a result was contemplated and desired. Gill v. Rollins Protective Servs. Co., 773 F.2d 592, 198 5 U.S. App. LEXIS 23318 (4th Cir. 1985), amended, 788 F.2d 1042, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 37434 (4th Cir. 1986). Nursing home not exempt as highly regulated.  In a complaint based on injuries sustained by a nursing home resident alleging violations of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA) from misrepresentations a s to the quality of care and the training of the facility workers, a motion to dismiss alleging that the facility was exempt from the VCPA under subsection A of § 59.1-199 as a highly regulated industry was denied because this section did not exempt e ntire industries from the VCPA, but claims arising from certain transactions. Beaty v. Manor Care, Inc., No. 02-1720-A, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25044 (E.D. Va. Feb. 10, 2003). Ac t inapplicable to claims governed by Truth In Lending Act.  The Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA) exempts from coverage any aspect of a consumer transaction governed by the federal Truth In Lending Act (TILA), and si nce the accuracy of sales tax disclosures are governed by the TILA, a consumer may not assert a claim under the VCPA based on an alleged misrepresentation as to the amount of the sales tax. Nigh v. Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc., 143 F. Supp. 2d 535, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5374 (E.D. Va. 2001), aff'd, 319 F.3d 119, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 1845 (4th Cir. 2003). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction.  Requirement of licensure for non-commercial lenders doing business in Virginia is not a discriminatory restraint on trade, but rather a prudent exercise of the co nstitutional police power to regulate fraudulent activity; this general obligation to obtain a license to engage in the business of making personal noncommercial loans and thus be subject to the supervisory eye of the State Corporation Commission, is har monized in subsection D of § 59.1-199. Commonwealth v. NC Fin. Solutions of Utah, LLC, 100 Va. Cir. 232, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 602 (Fairfax County Oct. 28, 2018). All the entities qualifying for exemption are already required to be subject to either licensure or regulatory oversight elsewhere in the Code. Commonwealth v. NC Fin. Solutions of Utah, LLC, 100 Va. Cir. 232, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 602 (Fairfax County Oct. 28, 2018). Subsection D of § 59.1-199 enumerates for exemption only businesses that are already licensed or regulated elsewhere in the code; independent of the prerequisi te of licensure to gain benefit of the safe harbor from suit pursuant to the blanket requirement in § 6.2-1500, subsection D of § 59.1-199 itself further accentuates the exception for small loan companies applies only if they are already regulated and supervised by the State Corporation Commission or a comparable federal regulating body. Commonwealth v. NC Fin. Solutions of Utah, LLC, 100 Va. Cir. 232, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 602 (Fairfax County Oct. 28, 2018). It would be erroneous for the court to apply the rule of the last antecedent to subsection D of § 59.1-199, and thereby find that small loan companies that are not regulated and supervised by the State Corporation Commission (SCC) are exempt from the Virginia Consumer Protection Act; the qualifier phrase bestowing exemption from the Act applies only to the listed entities specified in subsection D of § 59.1-199, all of which are of a financial class, as long as they are both regulated and supervised by the SCC or comparable body. Commonwealth v. NC Fin. Solutions of Utah, LLC, 100 Va. Cir. 232, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 602 (Fairfax County Oct. 28, 2018). Claims against a bank.  Car buyers sued a bank, which was the assignee of a financing contract, alleging violations of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act. Though subsection D specifica lly exempted banks from liability under the Act, a holder clause in the financing agreement made the bank legally liable for all claims the buyers had against the car dealer; therefore, the banks demurrer was overruled. Carr v. Sheehy Ashland, Inc., 65 Va. Cir. 4, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 224 (Richmond Mar. 24, 2004). Preemption under Interstate Co mmerce Act.  Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, at 42 U.S.C.S. § 14706, applied to any property damage sustained after the carriers took receipt of the prope rty from the customer, regardless of where the damage actually occurred; therefore, the customer could not state a consumer protection claim for property damage resulting from the carriers transportation of property. Harlow v. Bekins A-1 Movers, Inc. , 59 Va. Cir. 198, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 89 (Fairfax County July 2, 2002). No preemption by federal T ruth In Lending Act.  Where car buyers sued a car dealer for violating the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, the dealers plea in bar was overruled because the Virginia Consumer Pro tection Act was not preempted by the Federal Truth in Lending Act unless a provision of the latter contradicted the requirements of the former, and the dealer made no such allegation. Carr v. Sheehy Ashland, Inc., 65 Va. Cir. 4, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 224 ( Richmond Mar. 24, 2004). Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act.  Under subsection C of this section the Virginia Consumer Protection Act was only preempted in those specific aspects regulated by the Federal Consumer Cre dit Protection Act (FCCPA), and as defendants alleged activities were not governed by the FCCPA because it was not a debt collector, plaintiffs claims against it were not preempted by the FCCPA.

Whenever th e attorney for the Commonwealth or the attorney for a county, city, or town has reasonable cause to believe that any person has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, any violation of § 59.1-200 or 59.1-200.1, the attorney for the Co mmonwealth or the attorney for a county, city, or town if, after making a good faith effort to obtain such information, is unable to obtain the data and information necessary to determine whether such violation has occurred, or that it is impractical for him to do so, he may apply to the circuit court within whose jurisdiction the person having information resides, or has its principal place of business, for an investigative order requiring such person to furnish to the attorney for the Commonwealth or attorney for a county, city, or town such data and information as is relevant to the subject matter of the investigation. B. The circuit courts are empowered to issue investigative orders, authorizing discovery by the same methods and procedures as set forth for civil actions in the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, in connection with investigations of violations of § 59.1-200 o r 59.1-200.1 by the attorney for the Commonwealth or the attorney for a county, city, or town. An application for an investigative order shall identify: 1. The s pecific act or practice alleged to be in violation of § 59.1-200 or 59.1-200.1; 2. The grounds which shall demonstrate reasonable cause to believe that a violation of § 59.1-200 or 59.1-200.1 may have occurred, may be occurring or may be about to occur; 3. The category or class of data or information requested in the investigative order; and 4. The reasons why the attorney for the Commonwealth or attorney for a county, city, or town is unable to obtain such data and information, or the reason why it is impractical to do so, w ithout a court order. C. Within 21 d ays after the service upon a person of an investigative order, or at any time before the return date specified in such order, whichever is later, such person may file a motion to modify or set aside such investigative order or to seek a protective order as provided by the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia. Such motion shall specify the grounds for modifying or setting aside the order, and may be based upon the failure of the application or the order to comply with the requirements of this section, or upon any constitutional or other legal basis or privilege of such person. D. Where the i nformation requested by an investigative order may be derived or ascertained from the business records of the person upon whom the order is served, or from an examination, audit or inspection of such business records, or from a compilation, abstract or s ummary thereof, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the information is substantially the same for the attorney for the Commonwealth or attorney for a county, city, or town as for the person from whom such information is requested, it shall be suff icient for that person to specify the records from which the requested information may be derived or ascertained, and to afford the attorney for the Commonwealth or attorney for the county, city, or town reasonable opportunity to examine, audit or inspec t such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts or summaries thereof. E. It shall be the duty of the attorney for the Commonwealth or attorney for a county, city, or town, his assistants, employees and agents, to maintain the secrecy of all evidence, documents, data and information obtained through the use of investigative orders or obt ained as a result of the voluntary act of the person under investigation and it shall be unlawful for any person participating in such investigations to disclose to any other person not participating in such investigation any information so obtained. Any person violating this subsection shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor and shall be punished in accordance with § 18.2-11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section shall not preclude the presentation and disclosure of any information obtained p ursuant to this section in any suit or action in any court of this Commonwealth wherein it is alleged that a violation of § 59.1-200 or 59.1-200.1 has occurred, is occurring or may occur, nor shall this section prevent the disclosure of any such infor mation by the attorney for the Commonwealth or attorney for a county, city, or town to any federal or state law-enforcement authority that has restrictions governing confidentiality and the use of such information similar to those contained in this subse ction; however, such disclosures may only be made as to information obtained after July 1, 1979. F. Upon the fa ilure of a person without lawful excuse to obey an investigative order under this section, the attorney for the Commonwealth or attorney for the county, city, or town may initiate contempt proceedings in the circuit court that issued the order to hold su ch person in contempt. G. No informat ion, facts or data obtained through an investigative order shall be admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding other than for the enforcement of this chapter and the remedies provided herein.

For article, Determining the Deception of Sexual Orientation Change Efforts, see 58 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 641 (2016). CASE NOTES Reasonable cause less than pro bable cause.  An application for an investigative order must show that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the act has occurred, is occurring or wi ll occur; this reasonable cause standard requires less than the probable cause standard and does not require a showing that a violation has in fact occurred. Paramount Builders, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 260 Va. 22, 530 S.E.2d 142, 2000 Va. LEXIS 85 (2000). Showing required for civil investigative order.  Subsection A of this statute describes the circumstances under which an application for a civil investigative order is appropriate and subsection B incorporates t hose circumstances into conditions which must be identified in the application before a circuit court can issue a civil investigative order; this statutory scheme does not impose a two-step compliance process and the commonwealth is not required to make a factual showing under subsection A that it had reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the consumer protection act had occurred, was occurring or would occur, and that it had made a good faith effort to acquire the desired information and was u nsuccessful, or that it was impractical to seek the information without a court order in order to obtain a civil investigative order. Paramount Builders, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 260 Va. 22, 530 S.E.2d 142, 2000 Va. LEXIS 85 (2000). Un able or impractical to obtain information without order.  Subsection B 4 is intended to require the application to identify one of two mutually exclusive circumstances, either of which will support the need for a court o rder. The first circumstance is that, even though the commonwealth made good faith efforts, it was unable to obtain the information and the second is that such good faith efforts to obtain the information were not made because to do so would have been impractical. Paramount Builders, Inc. v.

Such assurance of voluntary compliance may at any time be reopened by the Attorney General, or the attorney for the Commonwealth, or attorney for the county, city, or town respectively, for additional orders or decrees to enforce the assurance of voluntary compliance. B. When an ass urance is presented to the circuit court for approval, the Attorney General, the attorney for the Commonwealth, or the attorney for the appropriate county, city, or town shall file, in the form of a motion for judgment or complaint, the allegations which form the basis for the entry of the assurance. The assurance may provide by its terms for any relief which an appropriate circuit court could grant, including but not limited to restitution, arbitration of disputes between the supplier and its customers , investigative expenses, civil penalties and costs; provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize or require the Commonwealth, the Attorney General, an attorney for the Commonwealth or the attorney for any county, city or town to participate in arbitration of violations under this section.

No private suit for injunctive relief.  Because the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA) did not permit a private suit for injunctive relief, the district courts dismissal of plaintiffs claim s for injunctive relief was affirmed; the VCPA contained a bifurcated remedy scheme, whereby government officials could seek to enjoin violative conduct and individuals could seek damages.

Under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA), one may initiate an act under the VCPA only if he or she has suffered loss. Nigh v. Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, In c., 143 F. Supp. 2d 535, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5374 (E.D. Va. 2001), aff'd, 319 F.3d 119, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 1845 (4th Cir. 2003). Plaintiff purchasers Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA), §§ 59.1-196 through 59.1-207, claim survived defendant car dealers motion for judgment on the pleadings because, under the Supreme Court of Virginias definition of actual damages, the VCPA authorized recovery for emotional distress. Barnette v. Brook Rd., Inc., 429 F. Supp. 2d 741, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28555 (E.D. Va. 2006). Although the debtors, whose personal information was published by the creditor in its form of proof of claim, stated claims for relief under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act and the Virginia Personal Information Privacy Act, and the Virginia Health Records Privacy Act, but were not entitled to sanctions under 11 U.S.C.S. §§ 105 and 107, and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(b) and 9037. Maple v. Colonial Orthopaed ics, Inc., 434 Bankr. 363, 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 2497 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2010). Failure to prove loss resulting from violation.  A borrower had not shown that she suffered a loss as a result of a lenders violation of the act and, therefore, was not entitled to initiate an action for dam ages under this provision where, although the borrower did pay in excess of the amount allowed by statute in late charges, the lender had reimbursed her for the excess late fees, plus interest. Alston v. Crown Auto, Inc., 224 F.3d 332, 2000 U.S. App. LEX IS 15081 (4th Cir. 2000). Showing of reliance for private causes of action.  Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA), § 59.1-200 et seq., and specifically this section, as consistently construed by the courts, requires that a private VC PA claimant show that he relied on the alleged misrepresentations claimed to constitute the prohibited practice, and thus that his loss was caused by the prohibited practice. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court correctly concluded that a debtor was require d to prove reliance on the alleged misrepresentations of his creditors to recover under the VCPA. Cooper v. GGGR Invs., LLC, 334 Bankr. 179, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32333 (E.D. Va. 2005). Antique automobile buyers claim against a mechanic for violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, Va. Code Ann. § 59.1-196 et seq., was insufficien t to go to the jury because the buyers failed to produce evidence of misrepresentations concerning the purchase price of a donor car, which the mechanic purchased to provide parts for the buyers antique car, as the buyers did not show reliance and re sulting damages. Owens v. DRS Auto. Fantomworks, Inc., 288 Va. 489, 764 S.E.2d 256, 2014 Va. LEXIS 152 (2014). No private suit for injunctive relief.  Because the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA) did not permit a private suit for injunctive relief, the district courts dismissal of plaintiffs claim s for injunctive relief was affirmed; the VCPA contained a bifurcated remedy scheme, whereby government officials could seek to enjoin violative conduct and individuals could seek damages. Physicians Comm. for Responsible Med. v. General Mills, Inc., 28 3 Fed. Appx. 139, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 13020 (4th Cir. 2008). Reliance on misrepresentation no t shown.  Although a creditors failure to disclose the interests of another entity until settlement of a restructured financing deal and the failure of the creditor to disclose his interest in that entity was, in fact, a misrepresentation that violated subdivision A 1 or A 14 of § 59.1-200, the debtor did not contend that the use of another name in the solicitation or the failure to disclose the creditors intere st would have affected his decision; therefore, the bankruptcy courts factual finding that the debtor did not rely on the misrepresented identity of the organization with whom he was doing business was not clearly erroneous. Cooper v. GGGR Invs., LLC , 334 Bankr. 179, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32333 (E.D. Va. 2005). No sta nding where transaction lacked a consumer purpose.  Corporation lacked standing to bring suit under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act where the corporation was not engaged in a consumer transaction because the c orporation was not purchasing certificates of authenticity for a consumer purpose as intended by the act because (1) the corporation was not purchasing the certificates of authenticity to use for a personal, family, or household purpose, (2) rather, the purchases were made for investigatory purposes, namely to determine whether defendants were engaging in the sale of certificates of authenticity without the required software, and (3) the corporations purchases were made on its own behalf, not on beh alf of potential consumers of its software. Microsoft Corp. v. # 9 Software, Inc., No. 4:05cv106, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36710 (E.D. Va. Dec. 15, 2005). Where lenders charge of brokers fee for placing loan with its president was, at the least, a technical wrong and where the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act had nothing to do with the type of wrongful conduct engaged in by the lender, an award of attorneys fees was proper. Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, 230 Va. 422, 337 S.E.2d 291, 1985 Va. LEXIS 296 (1985). Granting of damages condition precedent to attorneys fees.  Granting of damages after an adjudication on the merits of a claim is a condition precedent to an award of attorneys fees under the Virginia Consumer Protecti on Act. Pitchford v. Oakwood Mobile Homes, Inc., 212 F. Supp. 2d 613, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13847 (W.D. Va. 2002).

For purposes of this section, prima facie evidence of a willful violation may be shown when the Attorney General, the attorney for the Commonwealth, or the attorney for the county, city, or town notifies the alleged violator by certified mail that an act or practice is a violation of § 59.1-200 or 59.1-200.1, and the alleged violator, after receipt of said notice, continues to engag e in the act or practice. B. Any person who willfully violates the terms of an assurance of voluntary compliance or an injunction issued under § 59.1-203 shall forfeit and pay to the Literary Fund a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 per violation.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Demurrer overruled.  Car dealers demurrer to a buyers claim under the Virginia Consumer Protection Law (Lemon Law), § 59.1-196 et seq., claim was overruled as the buyer ple d fraudulent concealment and recounted allegedly false statements made by a salesman; the phrase should have known, occurred only along with alternative language suggesting that the dealer was conscious of the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation s. The conclusion that the buyer stated a claim under § 59.1-196 was bolstered by the fact that § 59.1-207 explicitly reserved remedies for individuals aggrieved as a result of an unintentional violation.

Enforcement; remedies; civil investigative demands; assurances of voluntary compliance; restraining prohibited acts. Text A. Whenever th e Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that any person has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, any violation of this chapter, the Attorney General is empowered to issue a civil investigative demand.

Such assurance of voluntary compliance shall not be considered an admission of guilt or a violation for any purpose. Such assurance of voluntary compliance may at any time be reopened by the Attorney Ge neral or the attorney for the Commonwealth for additional orders or decrees to enforce the assurance of voluntary compliance. When an assurance is presented to the circuit court for approval, the Attorney General or the attorney for the Commonwealth shal l file, in the form of a complaint, the allegations that form the basis for the entry of the assurance. The assurance may provide by its terms for any relief that an appropriate circuit court could grant, including but not limited to arbitration of dispu tes between a person subject to the provisions of this chapter and any targets, investigative expenses, civil penalties, and costs, provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize or require the Commonwealth, the Attorney General, or any attorney for the Commonwealth to participate in arbitration of violations under this section.

Public policy balance struck in adopting this chapter.  By adopting the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, the General Assembly has struck the public-policy balance to be applied by courts in this Commonwealth in determining w hether an employee is guilty of misappropriation of trade secrets; subdivision 2 b (2) sets forth the appropriate factors for consideration. Dionne v. Southeast Foam Converting &amp; Packaging, Inc., 240 Va. 297, 397 S.E.2d 110, 1990 Va. LEXIS 121 (1990). Relationship with other laws.  Where a judgment creditor moved for a judgment on pleadings, a Virginia state court judgment for willful and malicious misappropriation of trade secrets was nondi schargeable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(4). Section 523(a)(6) did not apply as the state courts determination of willful and malicious misappropriation was sufficient to establish the elements essential to the Chapter 13 debtors liability for l arceny in the context of § 523(a)(4). La Bella Dona Skin Care, Inc. v. Harton (In re Harton), No. 12-36221-KRH, No. 13-03028-KRH, 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 4113 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Oct. 1, 2013). Burden of proof.  Under the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act, §§ 59.1-336 through 59.1-343, plaintiff had the burden to prove by a preponderance of evidence that defendants misappropriated its trade secrets; the Act did not shift the burden to defendants, once plaintiff made out a prima facie case, to prove that their product was independently derived. MicroStrategy Inc. v. Li, 268 Va. 249, 601 S.E.2d 580, 2004 Va. LEXIS 1 32 (2004). Defendants were properly granted summary judgment on plaintiff corporations Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act claim because the claim relied exclusively on a llegations and inferences instead of any sort of actual objective evidence; while defendants did have access to trade secrets, the corporations were unable to produce any evidence, even after discovery, that defendants business was using such trade s ecrets. Othentec Ltd. v. Phelan, 526 F.3d 135, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 10233 (4th Cir. 2008). Trial court erred in denying a prime contractors motion to strike the planning services providers claim that it breached a nondisclosure agreement where t he providers presented no evidence of a misappropriation under § 59.1-336 and failed to show how the agreement required the contractor to use the providers as subcontractors. Navar, Inc. v. Fed. Bus. Council, 291 Va. 338, 784 S.E.2d 296, 2016 Va. LEXI S 58 (2016). Trade secret misappropriation claim failed on summary judgment for failure to provide a scintilla of evidence or argument; the claimant did not meet its burden of proof because it provided nothing more than pure speculation and conclusory statements that a competitor used its trade secrets. ZUP, LLC v. Nash Mfg., Inc., 229 F. Supp. 3d 430, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5477 (E.D. Va. 2017), aff'd, 896 F.3d 1365, 2018 U.S . App. LEXIS 20712 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Sufficient allegations.  Where plaintiffs former employees testified that they used only public sources in developing software for plaintiffs competitor, and defense experts, whom the chancellor found more persuasive than plaintiffs expert, testified as to differences between the parties software designs and the employees ability to develop the competitors software from public sources, the record supported the cha ncellors finding that the employees and competitor did not misappropriate plaintiffs software design. MicroStrategy Inc. v. Li, 268 Va. 249, 601 S.E.2d 580, 2004 Va. LEXIS 132 (2004). In plaintiffs action against defendant alleging misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act, issuance of a prelim inary injunction was appropriate because plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits where (1) its proprietary information, including software and software documentation resided in Virginia; (2) the information and the sublicense constituted t...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-337"><akn:num>§ 59.1-337</akn:num><akn:heading>Injunctive relief</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Actual or t hreatened misappropriation may be enjoined. Upon application to the court, an injunction shall be terminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be continued for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation. B. In exceptio nal circumstances, an injunction may condition future use upon payment of a reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time for which use could have been prohibited. Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to, a material and preju dicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation that renders a prohibitive injunction inequitable. C. In appropri ate circumstances, affirmative acts to protect a trade secret may be compelled by court order. History History. 1986, c. 210. Annotations Law Review.

CASE NOTES Applicable law.  Federal district court applied the Virginia Supreme Courts principles to the trade secret owners request for permanent injunctive relief under the Virgini a Uniform Trade Secrets Act because applying the federal standard for injunctive relief would have trenched upon the Erie doctrine. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Kolon Indus., 894 F. Supp. 2d 691, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123890 (E.D. Va. 2012). Actu al or threatened disclosure required for injunction.  Absent evidence of actual or threatened disclosure of a trade secret, an injunction should not issue; mere knowledge of trade secrets is insufficient to support a n injunction under the terms of this section. Motion Control Sys., Inc. v. East, 262 Va. 33, 546 S.E.2d 424, 2001 Va. LEXIS 72 (2001). Jurisdiction over motion to dissolve.  Jurisdiction over the instant motion to dissolve the injunction existed without regard to the status of the pending appeal because the question of the injunctive relief ordered by the court was not on appeal. The Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) motion filed by defendants did not duplicate an appeal but merely asked that the court find that it was no longer equitable to enforce the injunction based on changed circumstanc es; a finding by the court that the injunction should have terminated based on a finding that the two documents were no longer trade secrets did not complicate issues on appeal as the question of the appropriateness of injunctive relief was not on appeal . MicroStrategy, Inc. v. Business Objects, S.A., 369 F. Supp. 2d 725, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8592 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 429 F.3d 1344, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 24774 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Injunction not overly broad.  In plaintiffs action against defendant alleging copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C.S. § 501 and misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of the Vi rginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act, a preliminary injunction was not improperly overbroad where it was narrowly tailored to limit the scope only to prevent defendants misappropriation of plaintiffs copyrighted material and trade secrets and did not prevent defendant from engaging in business. Datatel, Inc. v. Rose &amp; Tuck, LLC, No. 05-495, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29704 (E.D. Va. June 17, 2005). Irreparable harm not required.  Trade secrets owner did not have to prove irreparable harm or the lack of an adequate remedy at law to receive an injunction against the actual misappropriation o f its trade secrets. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Kolon Indus., 894 F. Supp. 2d 691, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123890 (E.D. Va. 2012). Injunctive relief granted.  Where the trial court was aware that the documents described might no longer constitute trade secrets under § 59.1-336, the court enjoined the defendant for a reasonable minimum period, at which time the defendant could petition the court to dissolve the injunction, should it desire to do so. MicroStrategy, Inc. v. Business Objects, S.A., 331 F. Supp. 2d 396, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18228 (E.D. Va. 2004), aff'd, 429 F.3d 1344, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 24774 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Trade secrets owner was granted a permanent injunction against a foreign company where the foreign company may have had no recoverable domestic assets, a balancin g of the equities strongly favored granting an injunction to foreclose the foreign company from benefitting from its misappropriation of the owners trade secrets, and the public interest was served by an injunction. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Ko lon Indus., 894 F. Supp. 2d 691, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123890 (E.D. Va. 2012). Motion to dissolve injunction was granted.  This section makes clear that the objectives of an injunction covering trade secrets will be when both the trade secrets cease to exist and any residual commercia l advantage is eliminated; thus, when the companys competitive recipe was no longer be considered a trade secret because it ceased to be economically valuable when the products and technology it references were outdated, and had not been available to the public for seven years, the injunction that prevented the competitor from using the recipe was dissolved. Microstrategy, Inc. v. Business Objects, S.A., 661 F. Supp. 2d 548, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92595 (E.D. Va. 2009). Motion to dissolve injunction wa s denied.  Although defendants produced some evidence that pertained to economic value, it largely relied on argument concerning the age and staleness of the documents and i n the absence of other evidence that the documents at issue would cease to be economically valuable or would become publicly available and considering that the injunction was only in place for nine months, the court could not find that the documents ceas ed to be trade secrets or that any commercial advantage dissipated such that the injunction should have been lifted. MicroStrategy, Inc. v. Business Objects, S.A., 369 F. Supp. 2d 725, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8592 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 429 F.3d 1344, 2005 U.S . App. LEXIS 24774 (Fed. Cir. 2005). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Generally.  Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act (VUTSA), § 59.1-336 et seq., does not prohibit mere maintenance of trade secrets initially acquired through proper means. Ra ther, the VUTSA prohibits acquisition by improper means of the trade secrets or the actual or threatened disclosure or use of them. Knowesis, Inc. v. Herrera, 103 Va. Cir. 175, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 459 (Fairfax County Oct. 2, 2019).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-338"><akn:num>§ 59.1-338</akn:num><akn:heading>Damages</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Except wher e the user of a misappropriated trade secret has made a material and prejudicial change in his position prior to having either knowledge or reason to know of the misappropriation and the court determines that a monetary recovery would be inequitable, a c omplainant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. If a compla inant is unable to prove a greater amount of damages by other methods of measurement, the damages caused by misappropriation can be measured exclusively by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriators unauthorized disclosur e or use of a trade secret. B. If willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award punitive damages in an amount not exceeding twice any award made under subsection A of this section, or $350,000 whichever amount is less. History History. 1986, c. 210; 1990, c. 344. Annotations Law Review. For annual survey of Virginia labor and employment law, see 40 U. Rich. L. Rev. 241 (2005). CASE NOTES Courts should be flexible.  Each case under this Act is controlled by its own peculiar facts and circumstances. Courts should remain flexible and imaginative. American Sales Corp. v. Adventu re Travel, Inc., 862 F. Supp. 1476, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12835 (E.D. Va. 1994) see also 867 F. Supp. 378 (E.D. Va. 1994). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No exclusive dominion.  Materials did not derive independent value and were largely available through the government, and thus plaintiffs claim for misappropriation of trade secrets failed; many of the materials, regardless of how they were ultimately acquired, were developed in support of plaintiffs prior government contract, thereby making them government property. As property not in plaintiffs exclusive dominion, the mate rials remained readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons who could obtain economic value from their disclosure. Futrend Tech., Inc. v. MicroHealth LLC, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 128 (Fairfax County Aug. 21, 2020). Generally.  Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act, § 59.1-336 et seq., prohibits acquisition of trade secrets by improper means. It does not prohibit maintenance of those sec rets after the initial proper acquisition unless one can prove an actual or threatened disclosure or use of those secrets. Knowesis, Inc. v. Herrera, 103 Va. Cir. 175, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 459 (Fairfax County Oct. 2, 2019). CASE NOTES Defendant not insulated by profit la ck.  The lack of significant profits does not insulate defendant from being obliged to pay for what it has wrongfully obtained in the mistaken belief its theft would b enefit it. American Sales Corp. v. Adventure Travel, Inc., 862 F. Supp. 1476, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12835 (E.D. Va. 1994) see also 867 F. Supp. 378 (E.D. Va. 1994). Competition not necessary.  In a suit brought by a former employer against a former employee and his new employers, the trial court erred by dismissing plaintiffs claims under the Virgin ia Uniform Trade Secrets Act, § 59.1-336 et seq., because its ruling was based upon the faulty premise that competition must be shown under § 59.1-336 as use of the misappropriated trade secret to compete with the holder of the trade secret (plaint iff) was not required to show damages. Collelo v. Geographic Servs., 283 Va. 56, 727 S.E.2d 55, 2012 Va. LEXIS 12 (2012). Policy and procedure man uals as trade secrets.  As the legal requirements of the Virginia Payday Loan Act, § 6.1-444 et seq. [now § 6.2-1800 et seq.], were vastly different from the detailed steps set for th in a payday lenders policy and procedure manuals, and these materials were the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain their secrecy, they were protected trade secrets. Check 'n Go of Va., Inc. v. Laserre, No. 6:04-CV-00050, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXI S 16591 (W.D. Va. Aug. 9, 2005). Measurement of damages.  This Act dictates that plaintiffs loss plus defendants unjust enrichment is the appropriate damages measure unless it would provide an inadequate sum; oth erwise it should be a reasonable royalty exclusively. American Sales Corp. v. Adventure Travel, Inc., 862 F. Supp. 1476, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12835 (E.D. Va. 1994) see also 867 F. Supp. 378 (E.D. Va. 1994). Measurement of reasonable royalty.  Reasonable royalty focuses on the approximation of the actual value of the infringed secret to the defendant, relying on the fiction that a license was to be gran ted at the time of beginning the infringement, and then determining what the license price should have been if both parties were reasonably trying to reach agreement. American Sales Corp. v. Adventure Travel, Inc., 862 F. Supp. 1476, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXI S 12835 (E.D. Va. 1994) see also 867 F. Supp. 378 (E.D. Va. 1994). The simplest measure of reasonable royalty is the actual market value of what has been appropriated. American Sales Corp. v. Adventure Travel, Inc., 862 F. Supp. 1476, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12835 (E.D. Va. 1994) see also 867 F. Supp. 378 (E.D. Va. 1994). No entitlement to royalty based on costs incurred by parent company.  Though a payday lender proved that a competitor misappropriated its trade secrets, the lender was not entitled to a reasonable royalty because the cost to develop the policy and procedure manuals that made up the trade secrets was wholly incurred by the lenders parent holding company, and the legal rights of parent and subsidiary corporations were separate. Check 'n Go of Va., Inc. v. Laserre, No. 6:04-CV-000 50, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16591 (W.D. Va. Aug. 9, 2005). Punitive damages not favored.  Virginia law does not favor punitive damages and reserves them for only the most egregious conduct. American Sales Corp. v. Adventure Travel, Inc., 862 F. Supp. 1 476, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12835 (E.D. Va. 1994) see also 867 F. Supp. 378 (E.D. Va. 1994). Punitive award denied.  While defendants use of the list was reprehensible and illegal, it was not a serious breach of loyalty, and it did not seriously harm the plaintiff. His ultim ate motive was to contact strong potential clients and develop his own business, not to ruin plaintiffs. Plaintiff did not show that defendant acted with conscious disregard for plaintiffs rights, only that defendant acted with anger and used informa tion it should not have. Therefore, the court could not find that defendants actions were willful and malicious and therefore denied plaintiffs request for punitive damages. American Sales Corp. v. Adventure Travel, Inc., 862 F. Supp. 1476, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12835 (E.D. Va. 1994) see also 867 F. Supp. 378 (E.D. Va. 1994). Attorney fees denied.  District court did not abuse its discretion by holding that the plaintiff did not act in bad faith in pursuing its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against defendant, and therefore defendant was not entitled to attorney fees, even though the claim was not legally sufficient, because the plaintiff offered evidence that if credited could have substantiated the claim, the claim had survived extensive pretrial motions, and the district court had needed several weeks to evaluate the trial evidence fully. Young Design, Inc. v. Teletronics Int'l, Inc., 38 Fed. Appx. 994, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 14570 (4th Cir. 2002). § 59.1-338.1. Attorneys fees. Text If the court determines that (i) a claim of misappropriation is made in bad faith, or (ii) willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party. History History. 1990, c. 344. Annotations CASE NOTES Trial and appellate fees included.  When a party to a Virginia Trade Secrets Act case does not prevail and is found to have acted in bad faith, the prevailing part may recover counsel fees not only incurred at the trial level, but also those incurred in a successful defense of all or part of the trial courts final judgment on appeal. Trident Perfusion Assocs. v. Lesnoff, 992 F. Supp. 829, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1203 (W.D. Va. 1998). Costs denied.  Although attorney fees were warranted in a trade secret misappropriation case, the statute did not provide a valid basis for an award of non-taxable costs for the prevailing party. E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Kolon Indus., 911 F. Supp. 2d 340, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176909 (E.D. Va. 2012), vacated, No. 13-1054, No. 14-1266, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 24933 (4th Cir. June 12, 2014). Attorney fees denied.  The Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act did not authorize an award attorneys fees because the plaintiff only prevailed in part, and thus, the evidence was not suff icient to establish that the defendants misappropriation was willful and malicious. MicroStrategy, Inc. v. Business Objects, S.A., 331 F. Supp. 2d 396, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18228 (E.D. Va. 2004), aff'd, 429 F.3d 1344, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 24774 (Fed . Cir. 2005). Attorney fees awarded.  Attorney fees were warranted because a trade secret owner presented overwhelming evidence of willful and malicious misappropriation of trade secrets, the appropri ator engaged in obstreperous litigation tactics that unnecessarily multiplied the proceedings, the misappropriation involved in the case was flagrant, and the compensatory and punitive damages awarded and permanent injunction granted did not detract from the propriety of an award of attorneys fees. E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Kolon Indus., 911 F. Supp. 2d 340, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176909 (E.D. Va. 2012), vacated, No. 13-1054, No. 14-1266, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 24933 (4th Cir. June 12, 2014).

For article, The Case Against Federalizing Trade Secrets, see 101 Va. L. Rev. 317 (2015). CASE NOTES Accrual of cause of action.  Plaintiff filed its copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets claims well within the three year statute of limitations requirement, because its case rested on defendants bid which advertised defendants extensive experience working with plaintiffs products and tools. Although defendant claimed that plaintiffs case fell outside the statute of limitations because one of the contrac ts between the parties was more than three years ago, the misappropriation of trade secrets did not occur until the year that plaintiff filed suit. Datatel, Inc. v. Rose &amp; Tuck, LLC, No. 05-495, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29704 (E.D. Va. June 17, 2005). Trade secrets claim was untimely because the alleged misappropriation could have been discovered earlier. Even if the claimant did not know that a former employee had disclosed supplier contact information that was one of its trade secrets, it knew that another company had acquired the information, and it could have taken reasonable steps to learn how that happened. Thousand Oaks Barrel Co., LLC v. Deep South Bar rels LLC, 241 F. Supp. 3d 708, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40011 (E.D.

Except as p rovided in subsection B of this section, this chapter displaces conflicting tort, restitutionary, and other law of this Commonwealth providing civil remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret. B. This chapte r does not affect: 1. Contr actual remedies whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret; or 2. Other civil remedies that are not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret; or 3. Criminal remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret. History History. 1986, c. 210. Annotations CASE NOTES Purpose of section.  The plain language of this preemption provision indicates that the law was intended to prevent inconsistent theories of relief for the same underlying harm by eli minating alternative theories of common-law recovery which are premised on the misappropriation of a trade secret. Smithfield Ham &amp; Prods. Co. v. Portion Pac, Inc., 905 F. Supp. 346, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17891 (E.D. Va. 1995). No preemption of alternative claims not based on trade secrets.  Unless it can be clearly discerned that the information in question constitutes a trade secret, a court cannot dismiss alternative theories of relief as preempted by the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act; thus, where the parties dispute whether allegedly misappropriated confidential information constituted trade secrets, a court will not find alternative claims preempted by the act. Stone Castle Fin., Inc. v. Fr iedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co., 191 F. Supp. 2d 652, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3764 (E.D. Va. 2002). Insurance companys claims against a former regional manager for tortious interference with contractual and/or prospective business relations and breach of fid uciary duties were not preempted by § 59.1-341 because the claims for tortious interference and breach of fiduciary duties were not entirely dependent on the managers alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. The claims for tortious interference and breach of fiduciary duties were based, in part, on the allegation that the manager solicited the managers coworkers to leave the insurance company to work for a competitor, and the insurance company did not allege that the identities of the cowor kers were uncovered solely through the misappropriation of trade secrets. Combined Ins. Co. of Am. v. Wiest, 578 F. Supp. 2d 822, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61436 (W.D. Va. 2008). Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act did not preempt plaintiffs conspiracy and other tort claims because those claims were not predicated entirely upon defendan ts alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Kolon Indus., 688 F. Supp. 2d 443, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76795 (E.D. Va. 2009), . Because the doctrine of respondeat superior does not conflict with the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act in any sense of the word, the preemption provision has no bearing upon a claim seeking to impose liability under that doctrine. Newport News Indus. v. Dynamic Testing, 130 F. Supp. 2d 745, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1080 (E.D. Va. 2001). Breach of fiduciary duty c laim was preempted.  Internet payment processing and billing services companys counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duty was dismissed where it was based on a computer design comp anys alleged misappropriation of trade secrets in hardware, software, and documents and as such, the counterclaim was displaced by the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act, § 59.1-336 et seq. S&amp;S Computers &amp; Design, Inc. v. Paycom Billing Servs., No . 5:00-CV-00058, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25874 (W.D. Va. Apr. 5, 2001). Dismissal based on preemption.  Defendants business conspiracy and common-law conspiracy claims would not be dismissed because applying the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Acts preemption provision would be premature as the court could not conclusively determine whether the information was a trade secret without the benefit of a factual record, and the court declined to enlarge the reach of Uniform Trade Secrets Acts statutory preemp tion to include confidential business information. Microstrategy Servs. Corp. v. OpenRisk, LLC, No. 1:14cv1244, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32719 (E.D. Va. Mar. 17, 2015), dismissed in part, No. 1:14cv1244, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59347 (E.D. Va. May 6, 2015). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Arbitration.  Parties could agree to submit a trade secret dispute to arbitration without violating the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. Joyner's Mech., Inc. v. Miller, 85 Va. Cir. 8 0, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 166 (Chesapeake May 24, 2012). No preem ption under Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act.  Plaintiffs allegations were not premised entirely on a claim for the misappropriation of a trade secret, it was merely a component of the conspiracy, and thus plaintiffs claims were not preempted under the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act; although the plaintiffs cited the misappropriation of trade secrets, their claims were not wholly reliant thereon and the demurrer was consequently overruled. Rogers Elec. of Va., Ltd. v. Sims, 93 Va. Cir. 484, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 239 (Chesapeake Feb. 13, 2015). Count did not simply allege the removal of trade secrets, it always alleged the erasure of unspecified computer data; plaintiffs claims were not wholly relian t on the misappropriation and thus the claims were not preempted under the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act, and the demurrer was overruled. Rogers Elec. of Va., Ltd. v. Sims, 93 Va. Cir. 484, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 239 (Chesapeake Feb. 13, 2015). Tortious interference alleged was not solely based upon the misappropriation of customers, but rather a coordinated effort to solicit customers, establish a compe ting entity, and so forth; plaintiffs claims were not wholly reliant on the misappropriation and thus the claims were not preempted under the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act, and the demurrer was overruled.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Referendum on pari-mutuel wagering.  A referendum on the question of whether pari-mutuel wagering should be permitted at a licensed racetrack and/or satellite facilities must be presented to the qual ified voters of a county or city. Voter approval of pari-mutuel wagering on live horse racing at a licensed racetrack constitutes voter approval of pari-mutuel wagering on simulcast horse racing at that licensed racetrack; however, voter approval of pari -mutuel wagering at a licensed racetrack does not constitute voter approval of pari-mutuel wagering at satellite facilities.

If an official is unable to perform any duty in connection with the powers and duties of the compact committee, the racing commission or equivalent thereof from his state shall designate an alternate who shall serve in his place and represent the party state as its official on the compact committee until that racing commission or equivalent thereof determines that the original representative official is able once again to perform his duties as that party states representative official on the compact committee. The designation of an alternate shall be communicated by the affected states racing commission or equivalent thereof to the compact committee as the committees bylaws may provide. § 7. Powers and duties of compact committee. In order to carry out the purposes of this compact, the compact committee is hereby granted the power and duty to: 1. Deter mine which categories of participants in live racing, including but not limited to owners, trainers, jockeys, grooms, mutuel clerks, racing officials, veterinarians, and farriers, and which categories of equivalent participants in live racing with pari-m utuel wagering authorized in two or more of the party states, should be licensed by the committee, and establish the requirements for the initial licensure of applicants in each such category, the term of the license for each category, and the requiremen ts for renewal of licenses in each category. Provided, however, that with regard to requests for criminal record on the issuance or renewal of a license, the compact committee shall determine for each category of participants in live racing which licensu re requirements for that category are, in its judgment, the most restrictive licensure requirements of any party state for that category and shall adopt licensure requirements for that category that are, in its judgment, comparable to those most restrict ive requirements. 2. Investigate applicants for a license from the compact committee and, as permitted by federal and state law, gather information on such applicants, including criminal history record inf ormation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and relevant state and local law-enforcement agencies, and, where appropriate, from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and law-enforcement agencies of other countries, necessary to determine whether a lice nse should be issued under the licensure requirements established by the committee as provided in paragraph 1 of this section. Only officials on, and employees of, the compact committee may receive and review such criminal history record information, and those officials and employees may use that information only for the purposes of this compact. No such official or employee may disclose or disseminate such information to any person or entity other than another official or employee of the compact commit tee. The fingerprints of each applicant for a license from the compact committee shall be taken by the compact committee, its employees, or its designee and, pursuant to Public Law 92-544 or Public Law 100-413, shall be forwarded to a state identificatio n bureau, or an association of state officials regulating pari-mutuel wagering designated by the Attorney General of the United States, for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a criminal history record check. Such fingerprints may be su bmitted on a fingerprint card or by electronic or other means authorized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other receiving law-enforcement agency. 3. Issue licenses to, and renew the licenses of, participants in live racing listed in paragraph 1 of this section who are found by the committee to have met the licensure and renewal req uirements established by the committee. The compact committee shall not have the power or authority to deny a license. If it determines that an applicant will not be eligible for the issuance or renewal of a compact committee license, the compact committ ee shall notify the applicant that it will not be able to process his application further. Such notification does not constitute and shall not be considered to be the denial of a license. Any such applicant shall have the right to present additional evid ence to, and to be heard by, the compact committee, but the final decision on issuance or renewal of the license shall be made by the compact committee using the requirements established pursuant to paragraph 1 of this section. 4. Enter into contracts or agreements with governmental agencies and with nongovernmental persons to provide personal services for its activities and such other services as may be necessa ry to effectuate the purposes of this compact. 5.

Virginias failure to redact SSNs before placing land records online meant that barring plaintiffs protected speech would not be narrowly tailored to Virginias interest in protecting individual privacy; therefore enforcing § 59.1-443.2 against plaintiff for the Virginia land records posted on her website violated the First Amendment. Ostergren v. Cuccinelli, 615 F.3d 263, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 15254 (4th Cir. 2010). Injunctive relief.  District court abused its discretion by not tailoring the scope of the remedy to fit the nature and extent of the constitutional violation; on remand the district court would require a more developed factual record to determine proper injunctive relief, which included evidence about the status and effectiveness of Virginias redaction efforts. Depending on the scope of § 59.1-443.2, this could also include evidence about non-Virginia public records that plaintiff would publish on her website; because the constitutional analysis turned on how Virginia has handled public records rather than on whose social security numbers were being exposed, the district co urt should frame the injunctive relief accordingly. Ostergren v. Cuccinelli, 615 F.3d 263, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 15254 (4th Cir. 2010). Sanctions.  Although the debtors, whose personal information was published by the creditor in its form of proof of claim, stated claims for relief under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act and the Virginia Personal Information Privacy Act, the Virginia Health Records Privacy Act, but were not entitled to sanctions under 11 U.S.C.S. §§ 105 and 107, and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(b) and 9037. Maple v. Colonial Orthopaedics, Inc., 434 Bankr. 363, 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 2497 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2010). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL No federal preemption.  Persuasive legal arguments exist to assert that the portion of the Virginia civil identity protection statute prohibiting the intentional communication of an indi viduals social security number, as contained in subdivision A 1 of § 59.1-443.2, is not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. Under facts identical to those presented in Fisher v. Communications Workers of America, 716 S.E.2d 396 (N.C. App. 2011), it is likely that Virginias courts would reach the same result. In the more likely ev ent of labor relations litigation arising on different facts, a much stronger prospect exists to successfully defeat a federal preemption claim. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable Richard H. Black, Member, Senate of Virginia, 12-107, 2013 V a. AG LEXIS 24 (4/12/13). § 59.1-443.3.

To verify the individuals age when providing age-restricted goods or services to the individual if there is a reasonable doubt of the individual having reached 18 years of age or o lder; 3. To prevent fraud or other criminal activity if the individual returns an item or requests a refund or an exchange and the merchant uses a fraud prevention service company or system.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prefatory Note. With the advent of electronic means of communication and information transfer, business models and methods for doing business have evolved to take advantage of th e speed, efficiencies, and cost benefits of electronic technologies. These developments have occurred in the face of existing legal barriers to the legal efficacy of records and documents which exist solely in electronic media. Whether the legal requirem ent that information or an agreement or contract must be contained or set forth in a pen and paper writing derives from a statute of frauds affecting the enforceability of an agreement, or from a record retention statute that calls for keeping the paper record of a transaction, such legal requirements raise real barriers to the effective use of electronic media. One striking example of electronic barriers involves so called check retention statutes in every State. A study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston id entified more than 2500 different state laws which require the retention of canceled checks by the issuers of those checks. These requirements not only impose burdens on the issuers, but also effectively restrain the ability of banks handling the checks to automate the process. Although check truncation is validated under the Uniform Commercial Code, if the banks customer must store the canceled paper check, the bank will not be able to deal with the item through electronic transmission of the infor mation. By establishing the equivalence of an electronic record of the information, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) removes these barriers without affecting the underlying legal rules and requirements. It is important to understand that the purpose of the UETA is to remove barriers to electronic commerce by validating and effectuating electronic records and sign atures. It is NOT a general contracting statute  the substantive rules of contracts remain unaffected by UETA. Nor is it a digital signature statute. To the extent that a State has a Digital Signature Law, the UETA is designed to support and complime nt that statute. A. Scope of the Act and Procedural Approach. The scope of this Act provides coverage which sets forth a clear framework for covered transactions, and also avoids unwarranted surprises for unsophisticated parties dealing in this relatively new media. The clarity a nd certainty of the scope of the Act have been obtained while still providing a solid legal framework that allows for the continued development of innovative technology to facilitate electronic transactions. With regard to the general scope of the Act, the Acts coverage is inherently limited by the definition of transaction. The Act does not apply to all writings and signatures, but only to electronic records and signatures relating to a transaction, defined as those interactions between people relating to business, commercial and governmental affairs. In general, there are few writing or signature requirements imposed by law on many of the standard transactions that had been considered for exclusion . A good example relates to trusts, where the general rule on creation of a trust imposes no formal writing requirement. Further, the writing requirements in other contexts derived from governmental filing issues. For example, real estate transactions we re considered potentially troublesome because of the need to file a deed or other instrument for protection against third parties. Since the efficacy of a real estate purchase contract, or even a deed, between the parties is not affected by any sort of f iling, the question was raised why these transactions should not be validated by this Act if done via an electronic medium. No sound reason was found. Filing requirements fall within Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] on governmental records. An exclusion of all real estate transactions would be particularly unwarranted in the event that a State chose to convert to an electronic recording system, as many have for Article 9 financing statement filings under the Uniform Commercial Code. The exclusion of specific Articles of the Uniform Commercial Code reflects the recognition that, particularly in the case of Articles 5, 8 and revised Article 9, electronic transactions were addressed in the specific contexts of those revision processes. In the context of Articles 2 and 2A the UETA provides the vehicle for assuring that such transactions may be accomplished and effected via an electronic medium. At such time as Articles 2 and 2A are revised the extent of coverage in those Articles/Acts may make application of this Act as a gap-filling law desirable. Similar considerations apply to the recently promulgated Uniform Computer Information Transaction s Act (UCITA). The need for certainty as to the scope and applicability of this Act is critical, and makes any sort of a broad, general exception based on notions of inconsisten cy with existing writing and signature requirements unwise at best. The uncertainty inherent in leaving the applicability of the Act to judicial construction of this Act with other laws is unacceptable if electronic transactions are to be facilitated. Finally, recognition that the paradigm for the Act involves two willing parties conducting a transaction electronically, makes it necessary to expressly provide t hat some form of acquiescence or intent on the part of a person to conduct transactions electronically is necessary before the Act can be invoked. Accordingly, Section 5 [§ 59.1-483] specifically provides that the Act only applies between parties that have agreed to cond...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-480"><akn:num>§ 59.1-480</akn:num><akn:heading>Definitions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text As used in this chapter: (1) Agreement means the bargain of the parties in fact, as found in their language or inferred from oth er circumstances and from rules, regulations, and procedures given the effect of agreements under laws otherwise applicable to a particular transaction.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Voter registration applications.  Although no law requires the acceptance of mailed voter registration applications with electronic signatures, the State Board of Elections is not precluded from d irecting that general registrars accept such applications, and the State Board, in its discretion, may do so. The State Board also has discretionary authority to establish criteria to preserve the security of confidential voter information and to ensure the authenticity and validity of electronic signatures. See opinion of Attorney General to Messrs. James M. Hinshaw, Daniel H. Haworth, W. Donald Brown, City of Norfolk Electoral Board, 13-111, 2014 Va. AG LEXIS 47 (9/26/14). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Agreement. Whether the parties have reached an agreement is determined by their express language and all surrounding circumstances. The Restatement 2d Contracts § 3 provi des that, An agreement is a manifestation of mutual assent on the part of two or more persons. See also Restatement 2d Contracts, Section 2, Comment b. The Uniform Commercial Code specifically includes in the circumstances from which an agreement may be inferred course of performance, course of dealing andusage of trade . . . as defined in the UCC. Although the definition of agreement in this Act does not make specific reference to usage of trade and other party conduct, this definition is not intended to affect the construction of the parties agreement under the substantive law applicable to a particular transaction. Where that law takes account of usage and conduct in informing the terms of the parties agreement, the usage or conduct would be relevant as other circumstances included in the definition under this Act. Where the law applicable to a given transaction provides that system rules and the like constitute part of the agreement of the parties, such rules will have the same effect in determining the parties agreement under this Act. For example, UCC Article 4 (Section 4-103(b)) provides that Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars and clearinghouse rules have the effect of agreements. Such agreements by law properly would be included in the definition of agreement in this Act. The parties agreement is relevant in determining whether the provisions of this Act have been varied by agreement. In addition, the parties agreement may establish the parameters of the parties use of electronic records and signatures, security procedures and similar aspects of the transaction. See Model Trading Partner Agreement, 45 Business Lawyer Supp. Issue (June 1990). See Section 5(b) [§ 59.1 -483(b)] and Comments thereto. 2. Automated Transaction. An automated transaction is a transaction performed or conducted by electronic means in which machines are used without human intervention to form contracts and p erform obligations under existing contracts. Such broad coverage is necessary because of the diversity of transactions to which this Act may apply. As with electronic agents, this definition addresses the circumstance where electronic records may result in action or performance by a party although no human re view of the electronic records is anticipated. Section 14 [§ 59.1-492] provides specific rules to assure that where one or both parties do not review the electronic records, the resulting agreement will be effective. The critical element in this definition is the lack of a human actor on one or both sides of a transaction. For example, if one orders books from Bookseller.com t hrough Booksellers website, the transaction would be an automated transaction because Bookseller took and confirmed the order via its machine. Similarly, if Automaker and supplier do business through Electronic Data Interchange, Automakers comput er, upon receiving information within certain pre-programmed parameters, will send an electronic order to suppliers computer. If Suppliers computer confirms the order and processes the shipment because the order falls within pre-programmed parame ters in Suppliers computer, this would be a fully automated transaction. If, instead, the Supplier relies on a human employee to review, accept, and process the Buyers order, then only the Automakers side of the transaction would be automated . In either case, the entire transaction falls within this definition. 3. Computer program. This definition refers to the functional and operating aspects of an electronic, digital system. It relates to operating instructions used in an electronic system such as an electronic agent. (See definition of Electronic Agent.) 4. Electronic. The basic nature of most current technologies and the need for a recognized, single term warrants the use of electronic as the defined term. The definitio n is intended to assure that the Act will be applied broadly as new technologies develop. The term must be construed broadly in light of developing technologies in order to fulfill the purpose of this Act to validate commercial transactions regardless of the medium used by the parties. Current legal requirements for writings can be satisfied by almost any tangible media, whether paper, other fibers, or even stone. The purpose and applicability of this Act covers intangible media which are techno logically capable of storing, transmitting and reproducing information in human perceivable form, but which lack the tangible aspect of paper, papyrus or stone. While not all technologies listed are technically electronic in nature (e.g., optical fiber technology), the term electronic is the most descripti ve term available to describe the majority of current technologies. For example, the development of biological and chemical processes for communication and storage of data, while not specifically mentioned in the definition, are included within the techn ical definition because such processes operate on electromagnetic impulses. However, whether a particular technology may be characterized as technically electronic, i.e., operates on electromagnetic impulses, should not be determinative of whethe r records and signatures created, used and stored by means of a particular technology are covered by this Act. ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-481"><akn:num>§ 59.1-481</akn:num><akn:heading>Scope</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), this chapter applies to electronic records and electronic signatures relating to a transaction.

See opinion of Attorney General to Messrs. James M. Hinshaw, Daniel H. Haworth, W. Donald Brown, City of Norfolk Electoral Board, 13-111, 2014 Va. AG LEXIS 47 (9/26/14). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. The scope of this Act is inherently limited by the fact that it only applies to transactions related to business, commercial (including consumer) and governmen tal matters. Consequently, transactions with no relation to business, commercial or governmental transactions would not be subject to this Act. Unilaterally generated electronic records and signatures which are not part of a transaction also are not cove red by this Act. See Section 2 [§ 59.1-480], Comment 12. 2. This Act affects the medium in which information, records and signatures may be presented and retained under current legal requirements. While this Act covers all electronic records and signatures which are used in a business, commercial (including consumer) or governmental transaction, the operative provisions of the Act relate to requirements for writings and signatures under other laws. Accordingly, the exc lusions in subsection (b) focus on those legal rules imposing certain writing and signature requirements which will not be affected by this Act. 3. The exclusions listed in subsection (b) provide clarity and certainty regarding the laws which are and are not affected by this Act. This section provides that transactions subject to specific laws are unaffected by this Act and leaves the balance subject to this Act. 4. Paragraph (1) excludes wills, codicils and testamentary trusts. This exclusion is largely salutary given the unilateral context in which such records are gener ally created and the unlikely use of such records in a transaction as defined in this Act (i.e., actions taken by two or more persons in the context of business, commercial or governmental affairs). Paragraph (2) excludes all of the Uniform Commercial Co de other than UCC Sections 1-107 and 1-206, and Articles 2 and 2A. This Act does not apply to the excluded UCC articles, whether in current or revised form. The Act does apply to UCC Articles 2 and 2A and to UCC Sections 1-107 and 1-206. 5. Articles 3, 4 and 4A of the UCC impact payment systems and have specifically been removed from the coverage of this Act. The check collection and electronic fu nd transfer systems governed by Articles 3, 4 and 4A involve systems and relationships involving numerous parties beyond the parties to the underlying contract. The impact of validating electronic media in such systems involves considerations beyond the scope of this Act. Articles 5, 8 and 9 have been excluded because the revision process relating to those Articles included significant consideration of electronic practices. Paragraph 4 provides for exclusion from this Act of the Uniform Computer Informa tion Transactions Act (UCITA) because the drafting process of that Act also included significant consideration of electronic contracting provisions. 6. The very limited application of this Act to Transferable Records in Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] does not affect payment systems, and the section is designed to apply to a transaction only through express agreement of the parties. The exclusion of Articles 3 and 4 will not affect the Acts coverage of Transferable Records. Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] is designed to allow for the development of systems which wi ll provide control as defined in Section 16 [§ 59.1-494]. Such control is necessary as a substitute for the idea of possession which undergirds negotiable instrument law. The technology has yet to be developed which will allow for the possessi on of a unique electronic token embodying the rights associated with a negotiable promissory note. Section 16s [§ 59.1-494s] concept of control is intended as a substitute for possession. The provisions in Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] operate as free standing rules, establishing the rights of parties using Transferable Records under this Act. The references in Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] to UCC Sections 3-302, 7-501, and 9-308 (R9-330(d)) are designed t o incorporate the substance of those provisions into this Act for the limited purposes noted in Section 16(c) [§ 59.1-494(c)]. Accordingly, an electronic record which is also a Transferable Record, would not be used for purposes of a transaction gover ned by Articles 3, 4, or 9, but would be an electronic record used for purposes of a transaction governed by Section 16 [§ 59.1-494]. However, it is important to remember that those UCC Articles will still apply to the transferable record in their own right. Accordingly, any other substantive requirements, e.g., method and manner of perfection under Article 9, must be complied with under those other laws. See Comments to Section 16 [§ 59.1-494]. 7. This Act does apply, in toto , to transactions under unrevised Articles 2 and 2A. There is every reason to validate electronic contracting in these situations. Sale and lease transactions do not implicate broad systems beyond the parties to the underlying transa ction, such as are present in check collection and electronic funds transfers. Further sales and leases generally do not have as far reaching effect on the rights of third parties beyond the contracting parties, such as exists in the secured transactions system. Finally, it is in the area of sales, licenses and leases that electronic commerce is occurring to its greatest extent today. To exclude these transactions would largely gut the purpose of this Act. In the event that Articles 2 and 2A are revised and adopted in the future, UETA will only apply to the extent provided in those Acts. 8. An electronic record/signature may be used for purposes of more than one legal requirement, or may be covered by more than one law. Consequently, it is importa nt to make clear, despite any apparent redundancy, in subsection (c) that an electronic record used for purposes of a law which is not affected by this Act under subsection (b) may nonetheless be used and validated for purposes of other laws not excluded by subsection (b). For example, this Act does not apply to an electronic record of a check when us ed for purposes of a transaction governed by Article 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code, i.e., the Act does not validate so-called electronic checks. However, for purposes of check retention statutes, the same electronic record of the check is covered by t his Act, so that retention of an electronic image/record of a check will satisfy such retention statutes, so long as the requirements of Section 12 [§ 59.1-490] are fulfilled. In another context, subsection (c) would operate to allow this Act to apply to what would appear to be an excluded transaction under subsection (b). For example, Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code applies generally to any transaction that creates a security interest in personal property. However, Article 9 excludes landlords liens. Accordingly, although this Act excludes from its application transaction s subject to Article 9, this Act would apply to the creation of a landlord lien if the law otherwise applicable to landlords liens did not provide otherwise, because the landlords lien transaction is excluded from Article 9. 9. Additional exclusions under subparagraph (b)(4) should be limited to laws which govern electronic records and signatures which may be used in transactions as d efined in Section 2(16) [§ 59.1-480(16)]. Records used unilaterally, or which do not relate to business, commercial (including consumer), or governmental affairs are not governed by this Act in any event, and exclusion of laws relating to such records may create unintended inferences about whether other records and signatures are covered by this Act. It is also important that additional exclusions, if any, be incorporated under subsection (b)(4). As noted in Comment 8 above, an electronic record used in a tran saction excluded under subsection (b), e.g., a check used to pay ones taxes, will nonetheless be validated for purposes of other,...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-482"><akn:num>§ 59.1-482</akn:num><akn:heading>Prospective application</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text This chapter applies to any electronic record or electronic signature created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored on or after the effective date of this chapter.

OFFICIAL COMMENT This section limits the applicability of this Act to transactions which parties have agreed to conduct electronically. Broad interpretation of the term agreement is necessary to assure that this Act has the widest possible application consistent with its purpose of removing barriers to electronic commerce. 1. This section makes clear that this Act is intended to facilitate the use of electronic means, but does not require the use of electronic records and signatures . This fundamental principle is set forth in subsection (a) and elaborated by subsections (b) and (c), which require an intention to conduct transactions electronically and preserve the right of a party to refuse to use electronics in any subsequent tran saction. 2. The paradigm of this Act is two willing parties doing transactions electronically. It is therefore appropriate that the Act is voluntary and preserves the grea test possible party autonomy to refuse electronic transactions. The requirement that party agreement be found from all the surrounding circumstances is a limitation on the scope of this Act. 3. If this Act is to serve to facilitate electronic transactions, it must be applicable under circumstances not rising to a full fledged contract to use electroni cs. While absolute certainty can be accomplished by obtaining an explicit contract before relying on electronic transactions, such an explicit contract should not be necessary before one may feel safe in conducting transactions electronically. Indeed, su ch a requirement would itself be an unreasonable barrier to electronic commerce, at odds with the fundamental purpose of this Act. Accordingly, the requisite agreement, express or implied, must be determined from all available circumstances and evidence. 4. Subsection (b) provides that the Act applies to transactions in which the parties have agreed to conduct the transaction electronically. In this context it is essential that the parties actions and words be broadly construed in determining whether the requisite agreement exists. Accordingly, the Act expressly provides that the partys agreement is to be found from all circumstances, including the partie s conduct. The critical element is the intent of a party to conduct a transaction electronically. Once that intent is established, this Act applies. See Restatement 2d Contracts, Sections 2, 3, and 19. Examples of circumstances from which it may be found that parties have reached an agreement to conduct transactions electronically include the following: A. Automaker and supplier enter into a Trading Partner Agreement setting forth the terms, conditions and methods for the conduct of business between them electron ically. B. Joe gives out his business card with his business e-mail address. It may be reasonable, under the circumstances, for a recipient of the card to infer that Joe has agreed to communicate electronically for business purposes. However, in the absence of additional facts, it would not necessarily be reasonable to infer Joes agreement to communicate electronically for purposes outside the scope of the business i ndicated by use of the business card. C. Sally may have several e-mail addresses  home, main office, office of a non-profit organization on whose board Sally sits. In each case, it may be reasonab le to infer that Sally is willing to communicate electronically with respect to business related to the business/purpose associated with the respective e-mail addresses. However, depending on the circumstances, it may not be reasonable to communicate wit h Sally for purposes other than those related to the purpose for which she maintained a particular e-mail account. D. Among the circumstances to be considered in finding an agreement would be the time when the assent occurred relative to the timing of the use of electronic com munications. If one orders books from an on-line vendor, such as Bookseller.com, the intention to conduct that transaction and to receive any correspondence related to the transaction electronically can be inferred from the conduct. Accordingly, as to in formation related to that transaction it is reasonable for Bookseller to deal with the individual electronically. The examples noted above are intended to focus the inquiry on the partys agreement to conduct a transaction electronically. Similarly, if two people are at a meeting and one tells the other to send an e-mail to confirm a transaction  the requisite agreement under subsection (b) would exist. In each case, the use of a business card, statement at a meeting, or other evidence of willingness to conduct a tran saction electronically must be viewed in light of all the surrounding circumstances with a view toward broad validation of electronic transactions. 5. Just as circumstances may indicate the existence of agreement, express or implied from surrounding circumstances, circumstances may also demonstrate the absenc e of true agreement. For example: A. If Automaker, Inc. were to issue a recall of automobiles via its Internet website, it would not be able to rely on this Act to validate that notice in the case of a person who never logged on to the website, or indeed, had no ability to do so, notwithstanding a clause in a paper purchase contract by which the buyer agreed to receive such notices in such a manner. B. Buyer executes a standard form contract in which an agreement to receive all notices electronically is set forth on page 3 in the midst of other fine print. Bu yer has never communicated with Seller electronically, and has not provided any other information in the contract to suggest a willingness to deal electronically. Not only is it unlikely that any but the most formalistic of agreements may be found, but n othing in this Act prevents courts from policing such form contracts under common law doctrines relating to contract formation, unconscionability and the like. 6. Subsection (c) has been added to make clear the ability of a party to refuse to conduct a transaction electronically, even if the person has conducted transact ions electronically in the past. The effectiveness of a partys refusal to conduct a transaction electronically will be determined under other applicable law in light of all surrounding circumstances. Such circumstances must include an assessment of t he transaction involved. A partys right to decline to act electronically under a specific contract, on the ground that each action under that contract amounts to a separate transa ction, must be considered in light of the purpose of the contract and the action to be taken electronically. For example, under a contract for the purchase of goods, the giving and receipt of notices electronically, as provided in the contract, shoul d not be viewed as discreet transactions. Rather such notices amount to separate actions which are part of the transaction of purchase evidenced by the contract. Allowing one party to require a change of medium in the middle of the transaction ev idenced by that contract is not the purpose of this subsection. Rather this subsection is intended to preserve the partys right to conduct the next purchase in a non-electronic medium. 7. Subsection (e) is an essential provision in the overall scheme of this Act. While this Act validates and effectuates electronic records and electronic signatur es, the legal effect of such records and signatures is left to existing substantive law outside this Act except in very narrow circumstances. See, e.g., Section 16 [§ ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-484"><akn:num>§ 59.1-484</akn:num><akn:heading>Construction and application</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text This chapter shall be construed and applied to: (1) Faci litate electronic transactions consistent with other applicable law; (2) Be consistent with reasonable practices concerning electronic transactions and with the continued expansion of those practices; and (3) Effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this chapter among states enacting it.

The purposes and policies of this Act are: (a) to facilitate and promote commerce and governmental transactions by validating and authorizing the use of electronic records and electronic signatures; (b) to eliminate barriers to electronic commerce and governmental transactions resulting from uncertainties relating to writing and signature requirements; (c) to simplify, clarify and modernize the law governing commerce and governmental transactions through the use of electronic means; (d) to permit the continued expansion of commercial and governmental electronic practices through custom, usage and agreement of the parties; (e) to promote uniformity of the law among the States (and worldwide) relating to the use of electronic and similar technological means of effecting and performin g commercial and governmental transactions; (f) to promote public confidence in the validity, integrity and reliability of electronic commerce and governmental transactions; and (g) to promote the development of the legal and business infrastructure necessary to implement electronic commerce and governmental transactions. 2. This Act has been drafted to permit flexible application consistent with its purpose to validate electronic transactions. The provisions of this Act validating and effectuating the employ[ment] of electronic media allow the courts to apply them to new and unforeseen technologies and practices. As time progresses, it is anticipated that what is new and unforeseen today will be commonplace tomorrow. Accordingly, this legislation is intended to set a framework for the validation of media which may be developed in the future and which demonstrate the same qualities as the electronic media contemplated and validated under this Act.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-485"><akn:num>§ 59.1-485</akn:num><akn:heading>Legal recognition of electronic records, electronic signatures, and electronic contracts</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) A record o r signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.

Annotations OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Electronic notarial acts currently performed by Virginia notaries would constitute valid notarial acts under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, provided such acts comply with all o ther applicable statutes and regulations. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable John T. Frey, Clerk of the Circuit Court for Fairfax County, 08-089, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 8 (2/2/09). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. This section sets forth the fundamental premise of this Act: namely, that the medium in which a record, signature, or contract is created, presented or retaine d does not affect its legal significance. Subsections (a) and (b) are designed to eliminate the single element of medium as a reason to deny effect or enforceability to a record, signature, or contract. The fact that the information is set forth in an el ectronic, as opposed to paper, record is irrelevant. 2. Under Restatement 2d Contracts Section 8, a contract may have legal effect and yet be unenforceable. Indeed, one circumstance where a record or contract may ha ve effect but be unenforceable is in the context of the Statute of Frauds. Though a contract may be unenforceable, the records may have collateral effects, as in the case of a buyer that insures goods purchased under a contract unenforceable under the St atute of Frauds. The insurance company may not deny a claim on the ground that the buyer is not the owner, though the buyer may have no direct remedy against the seller for failure to deliver. See Restatement 2d Contracts, Section 8, Illustration 4. While this section would validate an electronic record for purposes of a statute of frauds, if an agreement to conduct the transaction electronically cannot reaso nably be found (See Section 5(b) [§ 59.1-483(b)]) then a necessary predicate to the applicability of this Act would be absent and this Act would not validate the electronic record. Whether the electronic record might be valid under other law is not ad dressed by this Act. 3. Subsections (c) and (d) provide the positive assertion that electronic records and signatures satisfy legal requirements for writings and signatures. The provi sions are limited to requirements in laws that a record be in writing or be signed. This section does not address requirements imposed by other law in addition to requirements for writings and signatures. See, e.g., Section 8 [§ 59.1-486]. Subsections (c) and (d) are particularized applications of subsection (a). The purpose is to validate and effectuate electronic records and signatures as the equi valent of writings, subject to all of the rules applicable to the efficacy of a writing, except as such other rules are modified by the more specific provisions of this Act. Illustration 1: A sends the following e-mail to B: I hereby offer to buy widgets from you, delivery next Tuesday. /s/ A. B responds with the following e-mail: I accept your offer to buy widgets for delivery next Tuesday. /s/ B. The e-mails ma y not be denied effect solely because they are electronic. In addition, the e-mails do qualify as records under the Statute of Frauds. However, because there is no quantity stated in either record, the parties agreement would be unenforceable under e xisting UCC Section 2-201(1). Illustration 2: A sends the following e-mail to B: I hereby offer to buy 100 widgets for $1000, delivery next Tuesday. /s/ A. B responds with the following e-mail: I accept your offer to purchase 100 widgets for $1000, delivery next Tuesday. /s/ B. In this case the analysis is the same as in Illustration 1 except that here the records otherwise satisfy the requirements of UCC Section 2-201(1). The transaction may not be denied legal effect solely because there is not a pen and ink writin g or signature. 4. Section 8 [§ 59.1-486] addresses additional requirements imposed by other law which may affect the legal effect or enforceability of an electronic record in a particular case. For example, in Section 8(a) [§ 59.1-486(a)] the legal requirement addressed is the provision of information in writing. The section then sets forth the standards to be applied in determining whether the provision of information by an electronic record is the equivalent of the provision of information in writing. The requirements i n Section 8 [§ 59.1-486] are in addition to the bare validation that occurs under this section. 5. Under the substantive law applicable to a particular transaction within this Act, the legal effect of an electronic record may be separate from the issue of wh ether the record contains a signature. For example, where notice must be given as part of a contractual obligation, the effectiveness of the notice will turn on whether the party provided the notice regardless of whether the notice was signed (See Sectio n 15 [§ 59.1-493]). An electronic record attributed to a party under Section 9 [§ 59.1-487] and complying with the requirements of Section 15 [§ 59.1-493] would suffice in that case, notwithstanding that it may not contain an electronic signatur e. OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Voter registration applications.  Although no law requires the acceptance of mailed voter registration applications with electronic signatures, the State Board of Elections is not precluded from d irecting that general registrars accept such applications, and the State Board, in its discretion, may do so. The State Board also has discretionary authority to establish criteria to preserve the security of confidential voter information and to ensure the authenticity and validity of electronic signatures.

History History. 2000, c. 995. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. This section is a savings provision, designed to assure, consistent with the fundamental purpose of this Act, that otherwise applicable substantive law will no t be overridden by this Act. The section makes clear that while the pen and ink provisions of such other law may be satisfied electronically, nothing in this Act vitiates the other requirements of such laws. The section addresses a number of issues relat ed to disclosures and notice provisions in other laws. 2. This section is independent of the prior section. Section 7 [§ 59.1-485] refers to legal requirements for a writing. This section refers to legal requiremen ts for the provision of information in writing or relating to the method or manner of presentation or delivery of information. The section addresses more specific legal requirements of other laws, provides standards for satisfying the more particular leg al requirements, and defers to other law for satisfaction of requirements under those laws. 3. Under subsection (a), to meet a requirement of other law that information be provided in writing, the recipient of an electronic record of the information must be able to get to the electronic record and read it, and must have the ability to get back to the information in some way at a later date. Accordingly, the section requires that the electronic record be capable of retention for later review. The section specifically provides that any inhibition on retention imposed by the sender or the senders system will preclude satisfaction of this section. Use of technological means now existing or later developed which prevents the recipient from retaining a copy of the information would result in a determination that information has not been provided under subsection (a). The policies underlying laws requir ing the provision of information in writing warrant the imposition of an additional burden on the sender to make the information available in a manner which will permit subsequent reference. A difficulty does exist for senders of information because of t he disparate systems of their recipients and the capabilities of those systems. However, in order to satisfy the legal requirement of other law to make information available, the sender must assure that the recipient receives and can retain the information. However, it is left for the courts to determine whether the sender has complied with this subsect ion if evidence demonstrates that it is something peculiar to the recipients system which precludes subsequent reference to the information. 4. Subsection (b) is a savings provision for laws which provide for the means of delivering or displaying information and which are not affected by the Act. For e xample, if a law requires delivery of notice by first class US mail, that means of delivery would not be affected by this Act. The information to be delivered may be provided on a disc, i.e., in electronic form, but the particular means of delivery must still be via the US postal service. Display, delivery and formatting requirements will continue to be applicable to electronic records and signatures. If those legal requirements can be satisfied in an electronic medium, e.g., the information can be pres ented in the equivalent of 20 point bold type as required by other law, this Act will validate the use of the medium, leaving to the other applicable law the question of whether the particular electronic record meets the other legal requirements. If a la w requires that particular records be delivered together, or attached to other records, this Act does not preclude the delivery of the records together in an electronic communication, so long as the records are connected or associated with each other in a way determined to satisfy the other law. 5. Subsection (c) provides incentives for senders of information to use systems which will not inhibit the other party from retaining the information. However, th ere are circumstances where a party providing certain information may wish to inhibit retention in order to protect intellectual property rights or prevent the other party from retaining confidential information about the sender. In such cases inhibition is understandable, but if the sender wishes to enforce the record in which the information is contained, the sender may not inhibit its retention by the recipient. Unlike subsection (a), subsection (c) applies in all transactions and simply provides for unenforceability against the recipient. Subsection (a) applies only where another law imposes the writing requirement, and subsection (a) imposes a broader responsibility on the sender to assure retention capability by the recipient. 6. The protective purposes of this section justify the non-waivability provided by subsection (d). However, since the requirements for sending and formatting and the like are imposed by other law, to the extent other law permits waiver of such protections, there is no justification for imposing a more severe burden in an electronic environment.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-487"><akn:num>§ 59.1-487</akn:num><akn:heading>Attribution and effect of electronic record and electronic signature</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) An electro nic record or electronic signature is attributable to a person if it was the act of the person. The act of the person may be shown in any manner, including a showing of the efficacy of any security procedure applied to determine the person to which the e lectronic record or electronic signature was attributable. (b) The effect of an electronic record or electronic signature attributed to a person under subsection (a) is determined from the context and surrounding circumstances at the time of its creation, execution, or adoption, including the parties agreement, if any, an d otherwise as provided by law. History History. 2000, c. 995. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Under subsection (a), so long as the electronic record or electronic signature resulted from a persons action it will be attributed to that person  the legal effect of that attribution is addressed in subsection (b). This section does not alter existing rules of law regarding attribution. The section assures that such rules will be applied in the electronic environment. A persons actions include ac tions taken by human agents of the person, as well as actions taken by an electronic agent, i.e., the tool, of the person. Although the rule may appear to state the obvious, it assures that the record or signature is not ascribed to a machine, as opposed to the person operating or programing the machine. In each of the following cases, both the electronic record and electronic signature would be attributable to a person under subsection (a): A. The person types his/her name as part of an e-mail purchase order; B. The persons employee, pursuant to authority, types the persons name as part of an e-mail purchase order; C. The persons computer, programmed to order goods upon receipt of inventory information within particular parameters, issues a purchase order which includes the persons name, or other identifying information, as part of the order. In each of the above cases, law other than this Act would ascribe both the signature and the action to the person if done in a paper medium. Subsection (a) expres sly provides that the same result will occur when an electronic medium is used. 2. Nothing in this section affects the use of a signature as a device for attributing a record to a person. Indeed, a signature is often the primary method for at tributing a record to a person. In the foregoing examples, once the electronic signature is attributed to the person, the electronic record would also be attributed to the person, unless the person established fraud, forgery, or other invalidating cause. However, a signature is not the only method for attribution. 3. The use of facsimile transmissions provides a number of examples of attribution using information other than a signature. A facsimile may be attributed to a pe rson because of the information printed across the top of the page that indicates the machine from which it was sent. Similarly, the transmission may contain a letterhead which identifies the sender. Some cases have held that the letterhead actually cons tituted a signature because it was a symbol adopted by the sender with intent to authenticate the facsimile. However, the signature determination resulted from the necessary finding of intention in that case. Other cases have found facsimile letterheads NOT to be signatures because the requisite intention was not present. The critical point is that with or without a signature, information within the electronic record may well suffice to provide the facts resulting in attribution of an electronic record to a particular party. In the context of attribution of records, normally the content of the record will provide the necessary information for a finding of attribution. It is also possi ble that an established course of dealing between parties may result in a finding of attribution. Just as with a paper record, evidence of forgery or counterfeiting may be introduced to rebut the evidence of attribution. 4. Certain information may be present in an electronic environment that does not appear to attribute but which clearly links a person to a particular record. Nume rical codes, personal identification numbers, public and private key combinations all serve to establish the party to whom an electronic record should be attributed. Of course, security procedures will be another piece of evidence available to establish attribution. The inclusion of a specific reference to security procedures as a means of proving attribution is salutary because of the unique importance of security procedures in the electronic environment. In certain processes, a technical and technological security procedure may be the best way to convince a trier of fact that a particular electronic record or signature was that of a particular person. In certain circumstan ces, the use of a security procedure to establish that the record and related signature came from the persons business might be necessary to overcome a claim that a hacker intervened. The reference to security procedures is not intended to suggest th at other forms of proof of attribution should be accorded less persuasive effect. It is also important to recall that the particular strength of a given procedure does not affect the procedures status as a security procedure, but only affects the wei ght to be accorded the evidence of the security procedure as tending to establish attribution. 5. This section does apply in determining the effect of a click-through transaction. A click-through transaction involves a process which, if exec uted with an intent to sign, will be an electronic signature. See definition of Electronic Signature. In the context of an anonymous click-through, issues of proof will be paramount. This section will be relevant to establish that the res ulting electronic record is attributable to a particular person upon the requisite proof, including security procedures which may track the source of the click-through. 6. Once it is established that a record or signature is attributable to a particular party, the effect of a record or signature must be determined in light of the context and surrounding circumstances, including the parties agreement, if any. Also informing the effect of any attribution will be other legal requirements considered in light of the context. Subsection (b) addresses the effect of the record or si gnature once attributed to a person.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-488"><akn:num>§ 59.1-488</akn:num><akn:heading>Effect of change or error</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If a change or error in an electronic record occurs in a transmission between parties to a transaction, the following rules apply: (1) If t he parties have agreed to use a security procedure to detect changes or errors and one party has conformed to the procedure, but the other party has not, and the nonconforming party would have detected the change or error had that party also conformed, t he conforming party may avoid the effect of the changed or erroneous electronic record. (2) In an automated transaction involving an individual, the individual may avoid the effect of an electronic record that resulted from an error made by the individual in dealing with t he electronic agent of another person if the electronic agent did not provide an opportunity for the prevention or correction of the error and, at the time the individual learns of the error, the individual: (A) Promptly notifies the other person of the error and that the individual did not intend to be bound by the electronic record received by the other person; (B) Takes reasonable steps, including steps that conform to the other persons reasonable instructions, to return to the other person or, if instructed by the other person, to des troy the consideration received, if any, as a result of the erroneous electronic record; and (C) Has not used or received any benefit or value from the consideration, if any, received from the other person. (3) If neither paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies, the change or error has the effect provided by other law, including the law of mistake, and the parties contract, if any. (4) Paragraphs (2) and (3) may not be varied by agreement. History History. 2000, c. 995. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. This section is limited to changes and errors occurring in transmissions between parties  whether person to person (paragraph 1) or in an automated transac tion involving an individual and a machine (paragraphs 1 and 2). The section focuses on the effect of changes and errors occurring when records are exchanged between parties. In cases where changes and errors occur in contexts other than transmission, th e law of mistake is expressly made applicable to resolve the conflict. The section covers both changes and errors. For example, if Buyer sends a message to Seller ordering 100 widgets, but Buyers information processing system cha nges the order to 1000 widgets, a change has occurred between what Buyer transmitted and what Seller received. If on the other hand, Buyer typed in 1000 intending to order only 100, but sent the message before noting the mistake, an error would h ave occurred which would also be covered by this section. 2. Paragraph (1) deals with any transmission where the parties have agreed to use a security procedure to detect changes and errors. It operates against the non-c onforming party, i.e., the party in the best position to have avoided the change or error, regardless of whether that person is the sender or recipient. The source of the error/change is not indicated, and so both human and machine errors/changes would b e covered. With respect to errors or changes that would not be detected by the security procedure even if applied, the parties are left to the general law of mistake to resolve the dispute. 3. Paragraph (1) applies only in the situation where a security procedure would detect the error/change but one party fails to use the procedure and does not dete ct the error/change. In such a case, consistent with the law of mistake generally, the record is made avoidable at the instance of the party who took all available steps to avoid the mistake. See Restatement 2d Contracts, Sections 152-154. Making the erroneous record avoidable by the conforming party is consistent with Sections 153 and 154 of the Restatement 2d Contracts because the non-conforming p arty was in the best position to avoid the problem, and would bear the risk of mistake. Such a case would constitute mistake by one party. The mistaken party (the conforming party) would be entitled to avoid any resulting contract under Section 153 becau se s/he does not have the risk of mistake and the non-conforming party had reason to know of the mistake. 4. As with paragraph (1), paragraph (2), when applicable, allows the mistaken party to avoid the effect of the erroneous electronic record. However, the subsectio n is limited to human error on the part of an individual when dealing with the electronic agent of the other party. In a transaction between individuals there is a greater ability to correct the error before parties have acted on it. However, when an ind ividual makes an error while dealing with the electronic agent of the other party, it may not be possible to correct the error before the other party has shipped or taken other action in reliance on the erroneous record. Paragraph (2) applies only to errors made by individuals. If the error results from the electronic agent, it would constitute a system error. In such a case the e ffect of that error would be resolved under paragraph (1) if applicable, otherwise under paragraph (3) and the general law of mistake. 5. The party acting through the electronic agent/machine is given incentives by this section to build in safeguards which enable the individual to prevent the sen ding of an erroneous record, or correct the error once sent. For example, the electronic agent may be programed to provide a confirmation screen to the individual setting forth all the information the individual initially approved. This would pro vide the individual with the ability to prevent the erroneous record from ever being sent. Similarly, the electronic agent might receive the record sent by the individual and then send back a confirmation which the individual must again accept before the transaction is completed. This would allow for correction of an erroneous record. In either case, the electronic agent would provide an opportunity for prevention or correction of the error, and the subsection would not apply. Rather, the effect of any error is governed by other law. 6. Paragraph (2) also places additional requirements on the mistaken individual before the paragraph may be invoked to avoid an erroneous electronic record. The i ndividual must take prompt action to advise the other party of the error and the fact that the individual did not intend the electronic record. Whether the action is prompt must be determined from all the circumstances including the individuals abili ty to contact the other party. The individual should advise the other party both of the error and of the lack of intention to be bound (i.e., avoidance) by the electronic record received. Since this provision allows avoidance by the mistaken party, that party should also be required to expressly note that it is seeking to avoid the electronic record, i.e., lacked the intention to be bound. Second, restitution is normally required in order to undo a mistaken transaction. Accordingly, the individual must also return or destroy any consideration receiv ed, adhering to instructions from the other party in any case. This is to assure that the other party retains control over the consideration sent in error. Finally, and most importantly in regard to transactions involving intermediaries which may be harmed because transactions cannot be unwound, the individual cannot have received any benefit from the transaction. This section prevents a party from unwinding a transaction after the delivery of value and consideration which cannot be returned or destroyed. For example, if the consideration received is information, it may not be possible to avoid the benefit conferred. While the information itself could be returned, mere access to the information, or the ability to redistribute the information, would constitute a benefit precluding the mistaken party from unwinding t he transaction. It may also occur that the mistaken party receives consideration which changes in value between the time of receipt and the first opportunity to return. In such a case restitution cannot be made adequately, and the transaction would not b e avoidable. In each of the foregoing cases, under subparagraph (2)(c), the individual would have received the benefit of the consideration and would NOT be able to avoid the erroneous electronic record under this section. 7. In all cases not covered by paragraphs (1) or (2), where error or change to a record occur, the parties contract, or other law, specifically including the law of mistake, applies to resolve any dispute. In the event that the parties contract and other law would achieve different results, the construction of the parties contract is left to the other law. If the error occurs in the context of record retention, Section 12 [§ 59.1-490] will apply. In that case the standard is one of accuracy and retrievability of the information. 8. Paragraph (4) makes the error correction provision in paragraph (2) and the application of the law of mistake in paragraph (3) non-variable. Paragraph (2) prov ides incentives for parties using electronic agents to establish safeguards for individuals dealing with them. It also avoids unjustified windfalls to the individual by erecting stringent requirements before the individual may exercise the right of avoid ance under the paragraph. Therefore, there is no reason to permit parties to avoid the paragraph by agreement. Rather, parties should satisfy the paragraphs requirements.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-489"><akn:num>§ 59.1-489</akn:num><akn:heading>Notarization and acknowledgment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If a law requires a signature or record to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the per son authorized to perform those acts, together with all other information required to be included by other applicable law, is attached to or logically associated with the signature or record.

See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable John T. Frey, Clerk of the Circuit Court for Fairfax County, 08-089, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 8 (2/2/09). OFFICIAL COMMENT This section permits a notary public and other authorized officers to act electronically, effectively removing the stamp/seal requirements. However, the section d oes not eliminate any of the other requirements of notarial laws, and consistent with the entire thrust of this Act, simply allows the signing and information to be accomplished in an electronic medium. For example, Buyer wishes to send a notarized Real Estate Purchase Agreement to Seller via e-mail. The notary must appear in the room with the Buyer, satisfy him/ herself as to the identity of the Buyer, and swear to that identification. All that activity must be reflected as part of the electronic Purchase Agreement and the notarys electronic signature must appear as a part of the electronic real estate purch ase contract. As another example, Buyer seeks to send Seller an affidavit averring defects in the products received. A court clerk, authorized under state law to administer oat hs, is present with Buyer in a room. The Clerk administers the oath and includes the statement of the oath, together with any other requisite information, in the electronic record to be sent to the Seller. Upon administering the oath and witnessing the a pplication of Buyers electronic signature to the electronic record, the Clerk also applies his electronic signature to the electronic record. So long as all substantive requirements of other applicable law have been fulfilled and are reflected in the electronic record, the sworn electronic record of Buyer is as effective as if it had been transcribed on paper.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-490"><akn:num>§ 59.1-490</akn:num><akn:heading>Retention of electronic record</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) If a law r equires that a record be retained, the requirement is satisfied by retaining an electronic record of the information in the record which: (1) Accu rately reflects the information set forth in the record at the time and after it was first generated in its final form as an electronic record or otherwise; and (2) Remains accessible for later reference.

(f) A record r etained as an electronic record in accordance with subsection A satisfies a law requiring a person to retain a record for evidentiary, audit, or like purposes, unless a law enacted after the effective date of this chapter specifically prohibits the use o f an electronic record for the specified purpose. (g) This secti on does not preclude a public body of the Commonwealth from specifying additional requirements for the retention of a record subject to such public bodys jurisdiction. History History. 2000, c. 995. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. This section deals with the serviceability of electronic records as retained records and originals. So long as there exists reliable assurance that the electro nic record accurately reproduces the information, this section continues the theme of establishing the functional equivalence of electronic and paper-based records. This is consistent with Fed.R.Evid. 1001(3) and Unif.R.Evid. 1001(3) (1974). This section assures that information stored electronically will remain effective for all audit, evidentiary, archival and similar purposes. 2. In an electronic medium, the concept of an original document is problematic. For example, as one drafts a document on a computer the original is either on a disc or the hard drive to which the document has been initially saved. If one periodically saves the draft, the fact is that at times a document may be first saved to disc then to hard drive, and at others vice versa. In such a case the origina l may change from the information on the disc to the information on the hard drive. Indeed, it may be argued that the original exists solely in RAM and, in a sense, the original is destroyed when a copy is saved to a disc or to the ha rd drive. In any event, in the context of record retention, the concern focuses on the integrity of the information, and not with its originality. 3. Subsection (a) requires accuracy and the ability to access at a later time. The requirement of accuracy is derived from the Uniform and Federal Rules of Eviden ce. The requirement of continuing accessibility addresses the issue of technology obsolescence and the need to update and migrate information to developing systems. It is not unlikely that within the span of 5-10 years (a period during which retention of much information is required) a corporation may evolve through one or more generations of technology. More to the point, these technologies may be incompatible with each other necessitating the reconversion of information from one system to the other. For example, certain operating systems from the early 1980s, e.g., memory typewriters, became obsolete with the development of personal computers. The informa tion originally stored on the memory typewriter would need to be converted to the personal computer system in a way meeting the standards for accuracy contemplated by this section. It is also possible that the medium on which the information is stored is less stable. For example, information stored on floppy discs is generally less stable, and subject to a greater threat of disintegration, than information stored on a computer hard drive. In either case, the continuing accessibility issue must be satisf ied to validate information stored by electronic means under this section. This section permits parties to convert original written records to electronic records for retention so long as the requirements of subsection (a) are satisfied. Accordingly, in the absence of specific requirements to retain written records, written records may be destroyed once saved as electronic records, satisfying the requirements of this section. The subsection refers to the information contained in an electronic record, rather than relying on the term electronic record, as a matter of clarity that the cri tical aspect in retention is the information itself. What information must be retained is determined by the purpose for which the information is needed. If the addressing and pathway information regarding an e-mail is relevant, then that information shou ld also be retained. However if it is the substance of the e-mail that is relevant, only that information need be retained. Of course, wise record retention would include all such information since what information will be relevant at a later time will n ot be known. 4. Subsections (b) and (c) simply make clear that certain ancillary information or the use of third parties, does not affect the serviceability of records and inf ormation retained electronically. Again, the relevance of particular information will not be known until that information is required at a subsequent time. 5. Subsection (d) continues the theme of the Act as validating electronic records as originals where the law requires retention of an original. The validation of electronic records and electronic information as originals is consistent with the Uniform Rules of Evidence. See Uniform Rules of Evidence 1001(3), 1002, 1003 and 1004. 6. Subsection (e) specifically addresses particular concerns regarding check retention statutes in many jurisdictions. A Report compiled by the Federal Reserve Ba nk of Boston identifies hundreds of state laws which require the retention or production of original canceled checks. Such requirements preclude banks and their customers from realizing the benefits and efficiencies related to truncation processes otherw ise validated under current law. The benefits to banks and their customers from electronic check retention are effectuated by this provision. 7. Subsections (f) and (g) generally address other record retention statutes. As with check retention, all businesses and individuals may realize significant savi ngs from electronic record retention. So long as the standards in Section 12 [§ 59.1-490] are satisfied, this section permits all parties to obtain those benefits. As always the government may require records in any medium, however, these subsections require a governmental agency to specifically identify the types of records and requirements that will be imposed.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-491"><akn:num>§ 59.1-491</akn:num><akn:heading>Admissibility of evidence</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) In any pro ceeding, evidence of a record or signature may not be excluded solely because it is in electronic form.

(3) The terms of the contract are determined by the substantive law applicable to the contract. History History. 2000, c. 995. Annotations Law Review. For 2000 survey of Virginia corporate and business law, see 34 U. Rich. L. Rev. 697 (2000). OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. This section confirms that contracts can be formed by machines functioning as electronic agents for parties to a transaction. It negates any claim that lack of human intent, at the time of contract formation, prevents contract formation. When machines are involved, the requisite intention flows from the programming and use of the machine. As in other cases, these are salutary provisions consistent with the fun damental purpose of the Act to remove barriers to electronic transactions while leaving the substantive law, e.g., law of mistake, law of contract formation, unaffected to the greatest extent possible. 2. The process in paragraph (2) validates an anonymous click-through transaction. It is possible that an anonymous click-through process may simply result in no r ecognizable legal relationship, e.g., A goes to a persons website and acquires access without in any way identifying herself, or otherwise indicating agreement or assent to any limitation or obligation, and the owners site grants A access. In suc h a case no legal relationship has been created. On the other hand it may be possible that As actions indicate agreement to a particular term. For example, A goes to a website and is confronted by an initial screen which advises her that the information at this site is proprietary, that A may use the information for her own personal purposes, but that, by clicking below, A agrees that any other use without the site owners permission is prohibited. If A clicks agree and downloads the information and then uses the information for other, prohibited purposes, should not A be bound by the click? It seems the answer properly should be, and would be, yes. If the owner can show that the only way A could have obtained the information was from his website, and that the process to access the subject information require d that A must have clicked the I agree button after having the ability to see the conditions on use, A has performed actions which A was free to refuse, which A knew would cause the site to grant her access, i.e., complete the transaction.  The terms of the resulting contract will be determined under general contract principles, but will include the limitation on As use of the information, as a condition precedent to granting her access to the information. 3. In the transaction set forth in Comment 2, the record of the transaction also will include an electronic signature. By clicking I agree, A adopted a pr ocess with the intent to sign, i.e., bind herself to a legal obligation, the resulting record of the transaction. If a signed writing were required under otherwise applicable law, this transaction would be enforceable. If a signed wri ting were not required, it may be sufficient to establish that the electronic record is attributable to A under Section 9 [§ 59.1-487]. Attribution may be shown in any manner reasonable including showing that, of necessity, A could only have gotte n the information through the process at the website.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-493"><akn:num>§ 59.1-493</akn:num><akn:heading>Time and place of sending and receipt</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) Unless oth erwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is sent when it: (1) Is a ddressed properly or otherwise directed properly to an information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retriev e the electronic record; (2) Is in a form capable of being processed by that system; and (3) Enters an information processing system outside the control of the sender or of a person that sent the electronic record on behalf of the sender or enters a region of the informatio n processing system designated or used by the recipient which is under the control of the recipient.

(c) Subsection (b) applies even if the place the information processing system is located is different from the place the electronic record is deemed to be received under subsection (d). (d) Unless oth erwise expressly provided in the electronic record or agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is deemed to be sent from the senders place of business and to be received at the recipients place of business. For purposes o f this subsection, the following rules apply: (1) If t he sender or recipient has more than one place of business, the place of business of that person is the place having the closest relationship to the underlying transaction. (2) If the sender or the recipient does not have a place of business, the place of business is the senders or recipients residence, as the case may be.

Except to the e xtent permitted by the other law, the requirements of this subsection may not be varied by agreement. History History. 2000, c. 995. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. This section provides default rules regarding when and from where an electronic record is sent and when and where an electronic record is received. This sectio n does not address the efficacy of the record that is sent or received. That is, whether a record is unintelligible or unusable by a recipient is a separate issue from whether that record was sent or received. The effectiveness of an illegible record, wh ether it binds any party, are questions left to other law. 2. Subsection (a) furnishes rules for determining when an electronic record is sent. The effect of the sending and its import are determined by other law once it is determined that a sending has occurred. In order to have a proper sending, the subsection requires that information be properly addressed or otherwise directed to the recipient. In order to send within the meaning of this section, there must be specific information which will direct the record to the intended recipient. Although mass electronic sending is not precluded, a general broadcast message, sent to systems rather than individuals, would not suf fice as a sending. The record will be considered sent once it leaves the control of the sender, or comes under the control of the recipient. Records sent through e-mail or the inter net will pass through many different server systems. Accordingly, the critical element when more than one system is involved is the loss of control by the sender. However, the structure of many message delivery systems is such that electronic records may actually never leave the control of the sender. For example, within a university or corporate setting, e-mail sent within the system to another faculty member is technically not out of the senders control since it never leaves the organizations server. Accordingly, to qualify as a sending, the e-mail must arrive at a point where the recipient has control. This section does not address the effect of an electronic record that is thereafter pulled back, e.g., removed from a mailbox. The analog in the paper world would be removing a letter from a persons m ailbox. As in the case of providing information electronically under Section 8 [§ 59.1-486], the recipients ability to receive a message should be judged from the perspective of whether the sender has done any action which would preclude retrieval . This is especially the case in regard to sending, since the sender must direct the record to a system designated or used by the recipient. 3. Subsection (b) provides simply that when a record enters the system which the recipient has designated or uses and to which it has access, in a form capable of being processed by that system, it is received. Keying receipt to a system accessible by the recipient removes the potential for a recipient leaving messages with a server or other service in order to avoid receipt. However, the section does not resolve the issue of how the sender proves the time of receipt. To assure that the recipient retains control of the place of receipt, subsection (b) requires that the system be specified or used by the recipient, and that the system be used or designated for the type of record being sent. Many people have multiple e-mail addresses for different purposes. Subsection (b) assures that recipients can designate the e-mail address or system to be used in a particular transaction. F or example, the recipient retains the ability to designate a home e-mail for personal matters, work e-mail for official business, or a separate organizational e-mail solely for the business purposes of that organization. If A sends B a notice at his home which relates to business, it may not be deemed received if B designated his business address as the sole address for business purposes. Whether actual knowledge upon seeing it at home would qualify as receipt is determined under the otherwise applicabl e substantive law. 4. Subsections (c) and (d) provide default rules for determining where a record will be considered to have been sent or received. The focus is on the place of bus iness of the recipient and not the physical location of the information processing system, which may bear absolutely no relation to the transaction between the parties. It is not uncommon for users of electronic commerce to communicate from one State to another without knowing the location of information systems through which communication is operated. In addition, the location of certain communication systems may change without either of the parties being aware of the change. Accordingly, where the pla ce of sending or receipt is an issue under other applicable law, e.g., conflict of laws issues, tax issues, the relevant location should be the location of the sender or recipient and not the location of the information processing system. Subsection (d) assures individual flexibility in designating the place from which a record will be considered sent or at which a record will be considered receive d. Under subsection (d), a person may designate the place of sending or receipt unilaterally in an electronic record. This ability, as with the ability to designate by agreement, may be limited by otherwise applicable law to places having a reasonable re lationship to the transaction. 5. Subsection (e) makes clear that receipt is not dependent on a person having notice that the record is in the persons system. Receipt occurs when the record reaches the designated system whether or not the recipient ever retrieves the record. The paper analog is the recipient who never reads a mail notice. 6. Subsection (f) provides legal certainty regarding the effect of an electronic acknowledgment. It only addresses the fact of receipt, not the quality of the con tent, nor whether the electronic record was read or opened. 7. Subsection (g) limits the parties ability to vary the method for sending and receipt provided in subsections (a) and (b), when there is a legal requirement for the sending or receipt. As in other circumstances where legal requirements derive from other substantive law, to the extent that the other law permits variation by agreement, this Act does not impose any additional requirements, and provisions of th is Act may be varied to the extent provided in the other law.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-494"><akn:num>§ 59.1-494</akn:num><akn:heading>Transferable records</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (a) In this se ction, transferable record means an electronic record that: (1) Woul d be a note under Title 8.3A or a document under Title 8.7 if the electronic record were in writing; and (2) The issuer of the electronic record expressly has agreed is a transferable record.

Paper negotiable instruments and documents are unique in the fact that a tangible token  a piece of paper  actually embodies intangible rights and obli gations. The extreme difficulty of creating a unique electronic token which embodies the singular attributes of a paper negotiable document or instrument dictates that the rules relating to negotiable documents and instruments not be simply amended to al low the use of an electronic record for the requisite paper writing. However, the desirability of establishing rules by which business parties might be able to acquire some of the benefits of negotiability in an electronic environment is recognized by th e inclusion of this section on Transferable Records. This section provides legal support for the creation, transferability and enforceability of electronic note and document equivalents, as against the issuer/obligo r. The certainty created by the section provides the requisite incentive for industry to develop the systems and processes, which involve significant expenditures of time and resources, to enable the use of such electronic documents. The importance of facilitating the development of systems which will permit electronic equivalents is a function of cost, efficiency and safety for the records. T he storage cost and space needed for the billions of paper notes and documents is phenomenal. Further, natural disasters can wreak havoc on the ability to meet legal requirements for retaining, retrieving and delivering paper instruments. The development of electronic systems meeting the rigorous standards of this section will permit retention of copies which reflect the same integrity as the original. As a result storage, transmission and other costs will be reduced, while security and the ability to s atisfy legal requirements governing such paper records will be enhanced. Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] provides for the creation of an electronic record which may be controlled by the holder, who in turn may obtain the benefits of holder in due course and good faith purchaser status. If the benefits and efficiencies of electronic media are to be realized in this industry it is essential to establish a means by which transactions involving paper promissory notes may be accomplished comple tely electronically. Particularly as other aspects of such transactions are accomplished electronically, the drag on the transaction of requiring a paper note becomes evident. In addition to alleviating the logistical problems of generating, storing and retrieving paper, the mailing and transmission costs associated with such transactions will also be reduced. 2. The definition of transferable record is limited in two significant ways. First, only the equivalent of paper promissory notes and paper documents of title can be created as transferable records. Notes and Documents of Title do not impact the broad systems that relate to the broader payment mechanisms related, for example, to checks. Impacting the check collection system by allowing for electronic checks  has ramifications well beyond the ability of this Act to address. Accordingly, this Act excludes from its scope transactions governed by UCC Articles 3 and 4. The limitation to promissory note equivalents in Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] is quite impor tant in that regard because of the ability to deal with many enforcement issues by contract without affecting such systemic concerns. Second, not only is Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] limited to electronic records which would qualify as negotiable promissory notes or documents if they were in writi ng, but the issuer of the electronic record must expressly agree that the electronic record is to be considered a transferable record. The definition of transferable record as an electronic record that . . . the issuer of the electronic record expre ssly has agreed is a transferable record indicates that the electronic record itself will likely set forth the issuers agreement, though it may be argued that a contemporaneous electronic or written record might set forth the issuers agreemen t. However, conversion of a paper note issued as such would not be possible because the issuer would not be the issuer, in such a case, of an electronic record. The purpose of such a restriction is to assure that transferable records can only be created at the time of issuance by the obligor. The possibility that a paper note might be converted to an electronic record and then intentionally destroyed, and the effect of such action, was not intended to be covered by Section 16 [§ 59.1-494]. The requirement that the obligor expressly agree in the electronic record to its treatment as a transferable record does not otherwise affect the characterization of a transferable record (i.e., does not affect what would be a paper note) because it is a statutory condition. Further, it does not obligate the issuer to undertake to do any other act than the payment of the obligation evidenced by the transferable r ecord. Therefore, it does not make the transferable record conditional within the meaning of Section 3-104(a)(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code. 3. Under Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] acquisition of control over an electronic record serves as a substitute for possession in the paper analog. Mo re precisely, control under Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] serves as the substitute for delivery, indorsement and possession of a negotiable promissory note or negotiable document of title. Section 16(b) [§ 59.1-494(b)] allows control to be found so long as a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable record reliably establishes [the person claiming control] as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred. The key point is that a system, whether involving third party registry or technological safeguards, must be shown to reliably establish the identity of the person entitled to payment. Section 16(c) [§ 59.1-494(c)] then sets forth a safe harbor list of very strict requirements for such a system. The specific provisions listed in Section 16(c) [§ 59.1-494(c)] are derived fr om Section 105 of Revised Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Generally, the transferable record must be unique, identifiable, and except as specifically permitted, unalterable. That authoritative copy must (i) identify the person claiming control as the person to whom the record was issued or most recently transferred, (ii) be maintained by the person claiming...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-495"><akn:num>§ 59.1-495</akn:num><akn:heading>Creation and retention of electronic records and conversion of written records by public bodies of the Commonwealth</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Upon providing protection to preserve security and confidentiality, every public body of the Commonwealth may create and retain electronic records and convert written r ecords to electronic records.

OFFICIAL COMMENT 1. Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] have been bracketed as optional provisions to be considered for adoption by each State. Among the barriers to el ectronic commerce are barriers which exist in the use of electronic media by state governmental agencies  whether among themselves or in external dealing with the private sector. In those circumstances where the government acts as a commercial party, e.g., in areas of procurement, the general validation provisions of this Act will apply. That is to say, the government must agree to conduct transactions electronically with vendors and customers of government services. However, there are other circumstances when government ought to establish the ability to proceed in transactions electronically. Whether in regard to records and communications within and between governmental agencies, or with respect to information and filings which must be made with governmental agencies, these sections allow a State to establish the ground work for such electronicization. 2. The provisions in Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] are broad and very general. In many States they will be unnecessary because enacted legislatio n designed to facilitate governmental use of electronic records and communications is in place. However, in many States broad validating rules are needed and desired. Accordingly, this Act provides these sections as a baseline. Of paramount importance in all States however, is the need for States to assure that whatever systems and rules are adopted, the systems established are compatibl e with the systems of other governmental agencies and with common systems in the private sector. A very real risk exists that implementation of systems by myriad governmental agencies and offices may create barriers because of a failure to consider compa tibility, than would be the case otherwise. 3. The provisions in Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] are broad and general to provide the greatest flexibility and adaptation to the specific needs of the individual States. The differences and variations in the organization and structure of governmental agencies mandates this approach. However, it is imperative that each State always keep in mind the need to prevent the erection of barriers throug h appropriate coordination of systems and rules within the parameters set by the State. 4. Section 17 [§ 59.1-495] authorizes state agencies to use electronic records and electronic signatures generally for intra-governmental purposes, and to conv ert written records and manual signatures to electronic records and electronic signatures. By its terms the section gives enacting legislatures the option to leave the decision to use electronic records or convert written records and signatures to the go vernmental agency or assign that duty to a designated state officer. It also authorizes the destruction of written records after conversion to electronic form. 5. Section 18 [§ 59.1-496] broadly authorizes state agencies to send and receive electronic records and signatures in dealing with non-governmental persons. Ag ain, the provision is permissive and not obligatory (see subsection (c)). However, it does provide specifically that with respect to electronic records used for evidentiary purposes, Section 12 [§ 59.1-490] will apply unless a particular agency expres sly opts out. 6. Section 19 [§ 59.1-497] is the most important section of the three. It requires governmental agencies or state officers to take account of consistency in ap plications and interoperability to the extent practicable when promulgating standards. This section is critical in addressing the concern that inconsistent applications may promote barriers greater than currently exist. Without such direction the myriad systems that could develop independently would be new barriers to electronic commerce, not a removal of barriers. The key to interoperability is flexibility and adaptability. The requirement of a single system may be as big a barrier as the proliferation of many disparate systems. Legislative Note Regarding Adoption of Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] 1. Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] are optional sections for consideration by indiv idual legislatures for adoption, and have been bracketed to make this clear. The inclusion or exclustion of Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] will not have a detrimental impact on the uniformity of adoption of this Act, so long as Sections 1 -16 [§§ 59.1-479 to 59.1-494] are adopted uniformly as presented. In some States Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] will be unnecessary because legislation is already in place to authorize and implement government use of electronic medi a. However, the general authorization provided by Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] may be critical in some States which desire to move forward in this area. 2. In the event that a state legislature chooses to adopt Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497], a number of issues must be addressed: A. Is the general authorization to adopt electronic media, provided by Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] sufficient for the needs of the particular j urisdiction, or is more detailed and specific authorization necessary? This determination may be affected by the decision regardig the appropriate entity or person to oversee implementation of the use of electronic media (See next paragraph). Sections 17 -19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] are broad and general in the authorization granted. Certainly greater specificity can be added subsequent to adoption of these sections. The question for the legislature is whether greater direction and specificity is needed at this time. If so, the legislature should not enact Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] at this time. B. Assuming a legislature decides to enact Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497], what entity or person should oversee implementation of the government s use of electronic media? As noted in each of Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497], again by brackets, a choice must be made regarding the entity to make critical decisions regarding the systems and rules which will govern the use of elect ronic media by the State. Each State will need to consider its particular structure and administration in making this determination. However, legislatures are strongly encouraged to make compatibility and interoperability considerations paramount in maki ng this determination. C. Finally, a decision will have to be made regarding the process by which coordination of electronic systems will occur between the various branches of state gov ernment and among the various levels of government within the State. Again this will require consideration of the unique situation in each State. 3. If a State chooses not to enact Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497], UETA Sections 1-16 [§§ 59.1-479 to 59.1-494] will still apply to governm ental entities when acting as a person engaging in transactions within its scope. The definition of transaction includes governmental affairs. Of course, like any other party, the circumstances surrounding a transaction must indic ate that the governmental actor has agreed to act electronically (See Section 5(b) [§ 59.1-483(b)]), but otherwise all the provisions of Sections 1-16 [§§ 59.1-479 to 59.1-494] will apply to validate the use of electronic records and signatures in transactions involving governmental entities. If a State does choose to enact Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497], Sections 1-16 [§§ 59.1-479 to 59.1-494] will continue to apply as above. In addition, Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] will provide authorization for intra-governmental uses of electronic media. Finally, Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] provide a broader authorization for the State to develop systems and procedures for the use of electronic media in its relations with non-governmental entities and persons.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_59.1-498"><akn:num>§ 59.1-498</akn:num><akn:heading>59</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>1-498 through 59.1-501.

As used in this section:Base year means either of the two calendar years immediately preceding a qualified b usiness firms first year of grant eligibility, at the choice of the business firm.Federal minimum wage means the minimum wage standard as currently defined by the United States Department of Labor in the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq. Such definition applies to permanent full-time employees paid on an hourly or wage basis . For those permanent full-time employees filling permanent full-time, salaried positions, the minimum wage is defined as the employees annual salary divided by 52 weeks per year divided by 35 hours per week. Full month means the number of days that a permanent full-time position must be filled in order to count in the calculation of the job creation grant amount. A full month is calculated by dividing the total number of days in the calendar year by 12. A full month for the purpose of calculating job creation grants is equivalent to 30.416666 days. Grant eligible position means a new permanent full-time position created above the threshold number at an eligible business firm. Posit ions in retail, personal service or food and beverage service shall not be considered grant eligible positions.Minimum wage means the federal minimum wage or the Virginia minimum wage, whichever is higher. The Department shall determine whichever is higher for the current calendar year as of December 1 of the prior calendar year, and its determin ation shall be continuously in effect throughout the calendar year, regardless of changes to the federal minimum wage or the Virginia minimum wage during that year.Permanent fu ll-time position means a job of indefinite duration at a business firm located within an enterprise zone requiring the employee to report for work within the enterprise zone; and requiring (i) a minimum of 35 hours of an employees time per week for the entire normal year of the business firms operation, which normal year must consist of at least 48 weeks, (ii) a minimum of 35 hours of an employees time per week for the portion of the calendar year in which the employee was initially hired for or transferred to the business firm, or (iii) a minimum of 1,680 hours per year. Such position shall not include (i) seasonal, temporary or contract positions, (ii) a position created when a job function is shifted from an existing location in the Commonwealth to a business firm located within an enterprise zone, (iii) any position that previously existed in the Commonwealth, or (iv) positions created by a business that is simultaneously closing facilities in other areas of the Commonwealth.Qualified business firm means a business firm designated as a qualified business firm by the Department pursuant to § 59.1-542.Report to work means that the employee filling a permanent full-time position reports to the business zone establishment on a regular basis.Subsequent base year means the base year for calculating the number of grant eligible positions in a second or subsequent five consecutive calendar year grant period. If a second or subs equent five-year grant period is requested within two years after the previous five-year grant period, the subsequent base year will be the last grant year. The calculation of this subsequent base year employment will be determined by the number of perma nent full-time positions in the preceding base year, plus the number of threshold positions, plus the number of grant eligible positions in the final year of the previous grant period. If a business firm applies for subsequent five consecutive calendar y ear grant periods beyond the two years immediately following the completion of the previous five-year grant period, the business firm shall use one of the two preceding calendar years as the subsequent base year, at the choice of the business firm. Threshold number means an increase of four permanent full-time positions over the number of permanent full-time positions in the base year or subsequent base year.Virginia minimum wage means the appl icable minimum wage as determined pursuant to the Virginia Minimum Wage Act (§ 40.1-28.8 et seq.). B. A business firm shall be eligible to receive enterprise zone job creation grants for any and all years in which the business firm qualifies in the five consecutive calendar years period commencing with the first year of grant eligibility. A business firm may be eli gible for subsequent five consecutive calendar year grant periods if it creates new grant eligible positions above the threshold for its subsequent base year. C. The amount of the grant for which a business firm is eligible shall be calculated as follows: 1. Eithe r (i) $800 per year for up to five consecutive years for each grant eligible position that during such year is paid a minimum of 175 percent of the minimum wage and that is provided with health benefits, or (ii) $500 per year for up to five years for eac h grant eligible position that during such year is paid less than 175 percent of the minimum wage, but at least 150 percent of the minimum wage, and that is provided with health benefits. In areas with an unemployment rate that is one and one-half times or more the state average, or for businesses that are certified under regulations adopted by the Director of the Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity pursuant to subdivision 8 of § 2.2-1606, the business firm will receive $500 per year for up to five years for each grant eligible position that during such year is paid at least 125 percent of the minimum wage and that is provided with health benefits. Unemployment rates used to determine eligibility for the reduced wage rate threshold s hall be based on the most recent annualized unemployment data published by the Virginia Employment Commission. A business firm may receive grants for up to a maximum of 350 grant eligible jobs annually. 2. Positions paying less than 150 percent of the minimum wage or that are not provided with health benefits shall not be eligible for enterprise zone job creation grants. D. Job creatio n grants shall be based on a calendar year. The amount of the grant for which a qualified business firm is eligible with respect to any permanent full-time position that is filled for less than a full calendar year shall be prorated based on the number o f full months worked. E. The amount of the job creation grant for which a qualified business firm is eligible in any year shall not include amounts for grant eligible positions in any year other than the preceding calendar year. Job creation grants shall not be available for any calendar y ear prior to 2005. F. Permanent f ull-time positions that have been used to qualify for any other enterprise zone incentive pursuant to the Enterprise Zone Act (former § 59.1-270 et seq.) shall not be eligible for job creation grants and shall not be counted as a part of the minimum t hreshold of four new positions.

A consumer may invoke the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this subsection at any time by submitting a request to a controller specifying the consumer rights the consumer wishes to invoke. A known childs parent or legal guardian may invoke such consumer r ights on behalf of the child regarding processing personal data belonging to the known child. A controller shall comply with an authenticated consumer request to exercise the right: 1. To co nfirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumers personal data and to access such personal data; 2. To correct inaccuracies in the consumers personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumers personal data; 3. To delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer; 4. To obtain a copy of the consumers personal data that the consumer previously provided to the controller in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means; and 5. To opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of (i) targeted advertising, (ii) the sale of personal data, or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer. B. Except as o therwise provided in this chapter, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to subsection A as follows: 1. A con troller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases within 45 days of receipt of the request submitted pursuant to the methods described in subsection A. The response period may be extended once by 45 additional days when reasonab ly necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the consumers requests, so long as the controller informs the consumer of any such extension within the initial 45-day response period, together with the reason for the extension. 2. If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumers request, the controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases and at the latest within 45 days of receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and instructions for how to appeal the decision pursuant to subsection C. 3. Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a controller free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer. If requests from a consumer are manifestly u nfounded, excessive, or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive nature of the request. 4. If a controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action under s ubsection A and may request that the consumer provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumers request. 5. A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumers request to delete such data pursu ant to subdivision A 3 by either (i) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring the consumers personal data remains deleted from the businesss records and not using such retained data for any other purpose pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or (ii) opting the consumer out of the processing of such personal data for any purpose except for those exempted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. C. A controlle r shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controllers refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumers receipt of the decision pursuant to subdivision B 2. The appeal process shall be consp icuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to subsection A. Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to t he appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the Attorn ey General to submit a complaint.

A controlle r shall: 1. Limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer; 2. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, not process personal data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed purposes for which such personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumers consent; 3. Establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal d ata. Such data security practices shall be appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue; 4. Not process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers. A controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exe rcising any of the consumer rights contained in this chapter, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer. However, nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain or to prohibit a controller from offering a different price, ra te, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised his right to opt out pursuant to § 59.1-577 or the offer is related to a consumers voluntary partic ipation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program; and 5. Not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumers consent, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without proc essing such data in accordance with the federal Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.). B. Any provisi on of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any way consumer rights pursuant to § 59.1-577 shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable. C. Controllers shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes: 1. The c ategories of personal data processed by the controller; 2. The purpose for processing personal data; 3. How consumers may exercise their consumer rights pursuant § 59.1-577, including how a consumer may appeal a controllers decision with regard to the consumers request; 4. The categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any; and 5. The categories of third parties, if any, with whom the controller shares personal data. D. If a contro ller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such pr ocessing. E. A controlle r shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights under this chapter. Such means shall take into account the ways in which consumers normal ly interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request. Controllers shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights pursuant to § 59.1-577 but may require a consumer to use an existing account.

A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in meeting its obligations under this chapter. Such assistance shall include: 1. Takin g into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controllers obligation to respond to consumer righ ts requests pursuant to § 59.1-577. 2.

Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments pursuant to § 59.1-580. B. A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processors data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the na ture and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract shall also include requirements that the processor shall: 1. Ensur e that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data; 2. At the controllers direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is re quired by law; 3. Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processors compliance with the obliga tions in this chapter; 4. Allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controllers designated assessor; alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processors policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller upon request; and 5. Engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in accordance with subsection C that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the per sonal data. C. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on it by virtue of its role in the processing relationship as defined by this chapter. D. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A processor that continues to adhere to a contro llers instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. History History. 2021, Sp. Sess. I, cc. 35, 36.

The processing of personal data for purposes of profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of (i) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate im pact on, consumers; (ii) financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers; (iii) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonab le person; or (iv) other substantial injury to consumers; 4. The processing of sensitive data; and 5. Any processing activities involving personal data that present a heightened risk of harm to consumers. B. Data protec tion assessments conducted pursuant to subsection A shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the r ights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the proce ssing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed, shall be factored into this assessment by the controller.
