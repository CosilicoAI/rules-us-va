CASE NOTES Disc retion of Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.  Given that the statutes clearly permitted the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurants license for failing to meet the required food -beverage ratio, the court of appeals could not ignore the plain statutory language, and it had to affirm the ABC Boards decision to exercise its discretion of issuing a penalty; the plain language of the relevant statutes clearly gave the ABC Board the discretion to impose the penalty. Thormac, LLC v. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, 68 Va. App. 216, 807 S.E.2d 230, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 298 (2017). Discretion to deviate from guideline s.  Circuit court properly affirmed the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurants alcoholic beverage license and to impos e a fine because the ABC Boards majority opinion clearly recognized the ABC Boards broad discretion to deviate from its guidelines. Thormac, LLC v. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, 68 Va. App. 216, 807 S.E.2d 230, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 298 (2017). Circuit court properly affirmed the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurants alcoholic beverage license and to impos e a fine because the ABC Boards imposition of the penalty did not lead to a patently absurd result; the ABC Boards decision was consistent with the plain letter of the law, and the lesser penalty imposed reflected its decision that the restaurant s violation of the food-beverage ratio was a relatively minor one. Thormac, LLC v. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, 68 Va. App. 216, 807 S.E.2d 230, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 298 (2017). License suspended.  Circuit court properly upheld the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurants alcoholic beverage license and to impose a fine for failure to comply because the ABC Board explained its reasoning for deviating from its guidelines, and acting within its discretion, it chose not to apply the substantial compliance doctrine and to impose a penalty, as it was permitted to do b y the General Assembly.

Most of the cases noted below were decided under former § 4-96, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. Former § 4-96 did not prohibit the citys tax which by ordinance, imposed a retail sales tax on all food sold in restaurants in the city. The ordinance defined food to include any and all refreshments and nourishment, liquid or otherwise. City of Virginia Beach v. Virginia Restaurant Ass'n, 231 Va. 130, 341 S.E.2d 198, 1986 Va. LEXIS 174 (1986). Where an ordinance and statute are said to be in conflict, it is the duty of the courts to harmonize them, if reasonably possible, so that they can stand together. City of Virginia Beach v. Virginia Restaurant Ass'n, 231 Va. 130, 341 S.E.2d 198, 1986 Va. LEXIS 174 (1986). In deciding whether an act is regulation or taxation, the court looks to whether the mea sure raises general revenues or whether it imposes charges that are directly tied to the administration of the particular regulatory scheme that is sought to be imposed. Where the enactment was solely to raise revenues for the city, generally, in the pas t, such a measure has been considered a tax rather than a regulation. City of Virginia Beach v. Virginia Restaurant Ass'n, 231 Va. 130, 341 S.E.2d 198, 1986 Va. LEXIS 174 (1986). Given the frequent use of the word tax in other parts of the ABC Act, it was significant that it was not used in this section where the legislature prohib its certain actions by localities. City of Virginia Beach v. Virginia Restaurant Ass'n, 231 Va. 130, 341 S.E.2d 198, 1986 Va. LEXIS 174 (1986). The ABC Act does not make manifest a legislative intent that no other enactments may touch upon alcoholic beverages in any way. City of Virginia Beach v. Virginia Restaurant Ass'n, 231 Va. 130, 341 S.E.2d 198, 1986 Va. LEXIS 174 (1986). A court will not hold that a legislative enactment preempts the entire field unless the court can find in the statute a manifest intent on the part of the legisla ture to preempt the field. City of Virginia Beach v. Virginia Restaurant Ass'n, 231 Va. 130, 341 S.E.2d 198, 1986 Va. LEXIS 174 (1986). Use of zoning to control location of establishments selling alcoholic beverages.  By enacting the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, the General Assembly did not intend to prohibit local governments from utilizing zoning as a means of controlling the location and concentration of establishments selling alcoholic beverages. City of Norfolk v. Tiny House, Inc., 222 Va. 414, 281 S.E.2d 836, 1981 Va. LEXIS 324 (1981). The Alcoholic Beverage Control Commissions (now Boards) exclusive authority to license and regulate the sale and purchase of alcoholic beverages in Virgin ia does not preclude a municipality from utilizing valid zoning ordinances to regulate the location of an establishment selling such alcoholic beverages. City of Norfolk v. Tiny House, Inc., 222 Va. 414, 281 S.E.2d 836, 1981 Va. LEXIS 324 (1981). Alcoholic Beverage Control Commissions (now Boards) exclusive authority to license and regulate alcohol sales did not preclude county from using zoning or dinances to prohibit lessee from selling alcoholic beverages at its sports complex. County of Chesterfield v. Windy Hill, Ltd., 263 Va. 197, 559 S.E.2d 627, 2002 Va. LEXIS 33 (2002). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Zoning ordinance exceeds powers granted by the General Assembly.  A county zoning ordinance for farm wineries, at least in part, is an invalid exercise of local authority because it exceeds the localitys delegated zoning aut hority and is preempted by state law governing alcoholic beverages.

Annotations CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Imputed knowledge of illegal drug sales.  Substantial evidence clearly supported the revocation of a license to sell alcoholic beverages pursuant to subdivision 1 p of § 4.1-225 where the licensee empl oyed two convicted felons, who sold and distributed drugs on the licensees premises at the same time as they were serving as agents or servants of the licensee.

Such manufacturer shall be limited to eight banquet licenses, whether or not jointly obtained, for such events per year without regard to the number of wineries or breweries owned or opera ted by such manufacturer or by any parent, subsidiary, or company under common control with such manufacturer. Where the event occurs on no more than three consecutive days, a manufacturer need only obtain one such license for the event. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, a manufacturer of distilled spirits, whether licensed in the Commonwealth or not, may obtain a banquet license for a special event as provided in subdivision D 1 b of § 4.1-206.3 upon application to the Board, provided that such event is (i) at a place approved by the Board and (ii) conducted for the purposes of featuring and educating the consuming public about the manufacturer s spirits products.

C. The General Assembly finds that it is necessary and proper to require a separation between manufacturing interests, wholesale interests, and retail interests in the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages in order to prevent suppliers from dominating loc al markets through vertical integration and to prevent excessive sales of alcoholic beverages caused by overly aggressive marketing techniques. The exceptions established by this section to the general prohibition against tied interests shall be limited to their express terms so as not to undermine the general prohibition and shall therefore be construed accordingly.

Service as a member of the board of directors of a corporation licensed as a retailer, the shares of stock of which are sold to the general public on any national or local stock exchan ge, shall not be deemed to be a financial interest, direct or indirect, in the business or the premises of the retail licensee. 3. A brewery, winery or subsidiary or affiliate thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as a financing corporation, may participate in financing the business of a wholesale licensee in the Commonwealth by providing debt or equity capital or both but only if done in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. a. In order to assist a proposed new owner of an existing wholesale licensee, a financing corporation may provide debt or equity capital, or both, if prior approval of the Board has been obtained pursuant to subdivision 3 b of subsection B. A financing corp oration which proposes to provide equity capital shall cause the proposed new owner to form a Virginia limited partnership in which the new owner is the general partner and the financing corporation is a limited partner. If the general partner defaults o n any financial obligation to the limited partner, which default has been specifically defined in the partnership agreement, or, if the new owner defaults on its obligation to pay principal and interest when due to the financing corporation as specifical ly defined in the loan documents, then, and only then, shall such financing corporation be allowed to take title to the business of the wholesale licensee. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary and provided written notice has been given to the Bo ard within two business days after taking title, the wholesale licensee may be managed and operated by such financing corporation pursuant to the existing wholesale license for a period of time not to exceed 180 days as if the license had been issued in the name of the financing corporation. On or before the expiration of such 180-day period, the financing corporation shall cause ownership of the wholesale licensees business to be transferred to a new owner. Otherwise, on the 181st day, the license shall be deemed terminated. The financing corporation may not participate in financing the transfer of ownership to the new owner or to any other subsequent owner for a period of twenty years following the effective date of the original financing transac tion; except where a transfer takes place before the expiration of the eighth full year following the effective date of the original financing transaction in which case the financing corporation may finance such transfer as long as the new owner is requi red to return such debt or equity capital within the originally prescribed eight-year period. The financing corporation may exercise its right to take title to, manage and operate the business of, the wholesale licensee only once during such eight-year p eriod. b. In any case in which a financing corporation proposes to provide debt or equity capital in order to assist in a change of ownership of an existing wholesale licensee, the parties to the transaction shall first submit an application for a wholesale license in the name of the proposed new owner to the Board.The Board shall be provided with all documents that pertain to the transaction at the time of the license application and shal l ensure that the application complies with all requirements of law pertaining to the issuance of wholesale licenses except that if the financing corporation proposes to provide equity capital and thereby take a limited partnership interest in the applic ant entity, the financing corporation shall not be required to comply with any Virginia residency requirement applicable to the issuance of wholesale licenses.

See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable David B. Albo, Member, House of Delegates, 05-075, 2006 Va. AG LEXIS 18 (6/1/06). An authorized representative cannot avoid application of the Wine Franchise Act or the Beer Franchise Act by requiring a waiver from the distributor because § § 4.1-416 and 4.1-515 prohibit such waivers. Additionally, the execution and filing of Attachments A and B and the exchange of purchase orders and invoices between authorized representatives and distributors do not constitute a written agreement o f definite duration pursuant to this section.

Some of the cases noted below were decided under former § 4-31, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. Constitutionality.  Subdivision A 2 d of former § 4-31 (see now subdivision 2 d of this section) was not unconstitutional as being vague and lacking in standards. Hamm v. Yeatts, 479 F. Supp. 267, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9603 (W.D. Va. 1979). Subdivision A 2 d of former § 4-31 (see now subdivision 2 d of this section) was a valid exercise of state discretion under the Twenty-First Amendment to say w here alcoholic beverages may or may not be sold. Hamm v. Yeatts, 479 F. Supp. 267, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9603 (W.D. Va. 1979). The purpose of subdivision A 2 d of former § 4-31 (see now subdivision 2 d of this se ction) was to protect the quietude and tranquility of residences or residential areas. Hamm v. Yeatts, 479 F. Supp. 267, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9603 (W.D. Va. 1979). Several factors involved in determination under subdivision A 2 d.  Distance from a residence or residential area is but one factor of the many factors which are involved in a determination under subdivision A 2 d of former § 4 -31 (see now subdivision 2 d of this section). The nature and character of the neighborhood, the topography of the land, the position of the properties and structures in relation to each other, and the existence of natural or man-made barriers are all ex amples of circumstances which are equally as important as distances in determining whether the granting of an alcoholic beverage control license may have an impact on the usual quietude and tranquility of a residence or residential area. Hamm v. Yeatts, 479 F. Supp. 267, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9603 (W.D. Va. 1979). But most important is will of reside nts.  Perhaps the most important factor in making a determination under subdivision A 2 d of former § 4-31 (see now subdivision 2 d of this section) was the will of the citizens and residents of the community. If the intent of the Twenty-First Amendment is to be effectuated then the federal courts must honor the will of the citizens of the state as to where alcoholic beverages may be sold. Hamm v. Yeatts, 479 F. Sup p. 267, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9603 (W.D. Va. 1979). Objections of local residents.  Neighbor objected to the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Boards granting of liquor licenses to an applicant. Her failure to timely appeal the Boards d ecision to grant such licenses was a waiver only of her challenge to the issuance of the licenses, not of her right to defend the Boards decision to impose a 12:00 a.m. restriction on alcohol sales. Harrison v. Ocean View Fishing Pier, LLC, 50 Va. Ap p. 556, 651 S.E.2d 421, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 397 (2007). Commerci al zoning not automatic qualifier for license.  The fact that building is located in an area zoned for commercial use does not automatically qualify the proposed business for an ABC license.

Whole sale beer or wine license to any person, unless such person has established or will establish a place or places of business within the Commonwealth at which will be received and from which will be distributed all alcoholic beverages sold by such person i n the Commonwealth.

Mixed beverage license if the Board determines that in the licensed establishment there (i) is entertainment of a lewd, obscene or lustful nature including what is commonly called stri pteasing, topless entertaining, and the like, or which has employees who are not clad both above and below the waist, or who uncommonly expose the body or (ii) are employees who solicit the sale of alcoholic beverages. 4. Wholesale wine license until the applicant has filed with the Board a bond payable to the Commonwealth, in a sum not to exceed $10,000, upon a form approved by the Board, signed by the applicant or licensee and a surety company authorized to do business in the Commonwealth as surety, and conditioned upon such persons (i) securing wine only in a manner provided by law, (ii) remitting to the Board the proper tax thereon, (iii) keepi ng such records as may be required by law or Board regulations, and (iv) abiding by such other laws or Board regulations relative to the handling of wine by wholesale wine licensees. The Board may waive the requirement of both the surety and the bond in cases where the wholesaler has previously demonstrated his financial responsibility. 5. Mixed beverage license to any member, agent, or employee of the Board or to any corporation or other business entity in which such member, agent or employee is a stockholder or has any other economic interest.Whenever any other elective or appointive official of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof applies for such a license or continuance thereof, he shall state on the application the official position he holds, and whenever a corporation or other business entity in which any such official is a stockholder or has any other economic interests applies for such a license, it shall state on the application the full economic interest of each such official in such corpora tion or other business entity. 6. License authorized by this chapter until the license tax required by § 4.1-231.1 is paid to the Board. History History.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases noted below were decided under former § 4-31, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. Immunity of Board members.  Scrutiny of the functions and duties of the members of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (now Board) and those designated by the Commission (now Board) to conduct hearings leads to the conclusion that the grant of absolute immunity from actions for damages, when they are performing in their adjudicatory capacities, is essential for the conduct of their affairs. Hamm v. Yeatts, 479 F. Supp. 267, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9603 (W.D. Va. 1979). Grounds for suspension must be charg ed.  When the statutory scheme is viewed in its totality, the Commission (now Board) must notify the licensee of a specific reason for a proposed suspension and the ev idence produced must substantiate the violation charged. The Commission (now Board) may not, therefore, suspend a license for a violation not charged. Atkinson v. Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Comm'n, 1 Va. App. 172, 336 S.E.2d 527, 1985 Va. App. LEX IS 80 (1985). Scope of federal court review.  Plaintiffs argument that his rights to substantive due process were violated when his application was denied, in that the Commissions (now Boards) con clusions did not conform to and were contrary to the evidence adduced at the hearing, was inappropriate, since it would be improper upon review for the federal court to determine either that the evidence relied upon by the Commission (now Board) was inco rrect or that conclusions reached were in error; rather the question for the federal court was whether the denial rested upon substantial evidence. Hamm v. Yeatts, 479 F. Supp. 267, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9603 (W.D. Va. 1979). Board lacks authority ov er land use and zoning.  Circuit court did not err in its determination that the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC Board) exceeded its authority in granting a farm winery lic ense to a farmer because the ABC Board exceeded its authority in determining that a county ordinance was unreasonable; nothing in the statute granted the ABC Board any authority over land use and zoning, and a municipality, not the ABC Board, had authori ty over zoning. Va. Alcoholic Bev. v. Bd. of Supervisors, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 311 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 6, 2018). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Board action constitutional.  Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Boards decision to deny a restaurants application for removal of license restrictions on the sale of alcohol was affir med as subdivision B 4 of § 4.1-224 did not violate the restaurants substantive and procedural due process rights, was not too broad in scope, and was not unconstitutional.

CASE NOTES First Amendment analysis.  Virginias alcohol licensing program, which allowed nightclubs employing erotic dancers to serve beer and wine but not mixed beverages, survived intermediate s crutiny, as the public interest served by the policy was substantial, the restriction on the clubs mild, and the burden on First Amendment values slight.

In addition, any subpoena for the production of documents issued to any person at the requ est of the licensee or the Board pursuant to § 4.1-103 shall provide for the production of the documents sought within ten working days, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in § 4.1-103.If the Board fails to provide for inspection or copying u nder this section for the licensee after a written request, the Board shall be prohibited from introducing into evidence any items the licensee would have lawfully been entitled to inspect or copy under this section.The action of the Board in suspending or revoking any license or in imposing a civil penalty against the holder of a brewery license shall be subject to judicial review in accordance with the Administrative Process Act. Such review shall extend to the entire evidential record of the proceedi ngs provided by the Board in accordance with the Administrative Process Act. An appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeals from any order of the court. Notwithstanding § 8.01-676.1, the final judgment or order of the circuit court shall not be suspended , stayed or modified by such circuit court pending appeal to the Court of Appeals. Neither mandamus nor injunction shall lie in any such case. B. In suspendi ng any license the Board may impose, as a condition precedent to the removal of such suspension or any portion thereof, a requirement that the licensee pay the cost incurred by the Board in investigating the licensee and in holding the proceeding resulti ng in such suspension, or it may impose and collect such civil penalties as it deems appropriate. In no event shall the Board impose a civil penalty exceeding $2,000 for the first violation occurring within five years immediately preceding the date of th e violation or $5,000 for the second violation occurring within five years immediately preceding the date of the second violation. However, if the violation involved selling alcoholic beverages to a person prohibited from purchasing alcoholic beverages o r allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage, intoxicated, or interdicted persons, the Board may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $3,000 for the first violation occurring within five years immediately preceding the date of the violation and $6,000 for a second violation occurring within five years immediately preceding the date of the second violation in lieu of such suspension or any portion thereof, or both. The Board may also impose a requirement that the licensee pay for the cost in curred by the Board not exceeding $25,000 in investigating the licensee and in holding the proceeding resulting in the violation in addition to any suspension or civil penalty incurred. C. Following n otice to (i) the licensee of a hearing that may result in the suspension or revocation of his license or (ii) the applicant of a hearing to resolve a contested application, the Board may accept a consent agreement as authorized in subdivision 21 of § 4.1-103. The notice shall advise the licensee or applicant of the option to (a) admit the alleged violation or the validity of the objection; (b) waive any right to a hearing or an appeal under the Virginia Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et se q.); and (c)(1) accept the proposed restrictions for operating under the license, (2) accept the period of suspension of the licensed privileges within the Boards parameters, (3) pay a civil penalty in lieu of the period of suspension, or any portion of the suspension as applicable, or (4) proceed to a hearing.

In case of an offense by the holder of a brewery license, the Board may (i) require that such holder pay the costs incurred by the Board in investigating the licensee, (ii) suspend or revoke the on-premises privileges of the brewery, and (iii) impose a civil penalt y not to exceed $25,000 for the first violation, $50,000 for the second violation, and for the third or any subsequent violation, suspend or revoke such license or, in lieu of any suspension or portion thereof, impose a civil penalty not to exceed $100,0 00. Such suspension or revocation shall not prohibit the licensee from manufacturing or selling beer manufactured by it to the owners of boats registered under the laws of the United States sailing for ports of call of a foreign country or another state, and to persons outside the Commonwealth. E. The Board s hall, by regulation or written order: 1. Desig nate those (i) objections to an application or (ii) alleged violations that will proceed to an initial hearing; 2. Designate the violations for which a waiver of a hearing and payment of a civil charge in lieu of suspension may be accepted for a first offense occurring within three years immediatel y preceding the date of the violation; 3. Provide for a reduction in the length of any suspension and a reduction in the amount of any civil penalty for any retail licensee where the licensee can demonstrate that it provided t o its employees alcohol server or seller training certified in advance by the Board; 4. Establish a schedule of penalties for such offenses, prescribing the appropriate suspension of a license and the civil charge acceptable in lieu of such suspension; and 5. Establish a schedule of offenses for which any penalty may be waived upon a showing that the licensee has had no prior violations within five years immediately preceding the date of th e violation. No waiver shall be granted by the Board, however, for a licensees willful and knowing violation of this subtitle or Board regulations. History History.

The cases noted below were decided under former § 4-57, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. Electi on to prosecute under former § 4-57 or former § 4-77.  Where accused was indicted for illegal manufacture of liquor in violation of former § 4-57 by the use of a still, and for illegal possession of the same still, in violation of former § 4-77 (see now §§ 4.1-212 and 4.1-314), the Commonwealth had the election to prosecute the greater offense, that is, the illegal manufacture, instead of the lesser offense of illegal possession, and when, upon appeal fro m convictions under both indictments, the Attorney General acquiesced in accuseds view that the prosecution for illegal possession should be dismissed, this would be treated as such election. Wheeler v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 665, 66 S.E.2d 605, 1951 Va. LEXIS 214 (1951), overruled, Watkins v. Commonwealth, 238 Va. 341, 385 S.E.2d 50, 6 Va. Law Rep. 472, 1989 Va. LEXIS 132 (1989). Manufacture within the purview of the statute is a continuing process. It includes activ e efforts and means employed in producing or creating alcoholic beverages. Strange v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 742, 30 S.E.2d 552, 1944 Va. LEXIS 228 (1944). Uncontradicted testimony regarding the presence of mash constituted illegal manufacture within the meaning of former § 4-57 (see now this section). Ruff v. Gathright, 373 F. Supp. 232, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (W.D. Va. 1974). For cases in which the accused was held to be present where a still was in operation within the meaning of a provision similar to subsection (b) of former § 4-57 , see Johnson v. Commonwealth, 142 Va. 639, 128 S.E. 456, 1925 Va. LEXIS 367 (1925); Langford v. Commonwealth, 154 Va. 879, 153 S.E. 821, 1930 Va. LEXIS 252 (1930); Brown v. Comm onwealth, 156 Va. 947, 157 S.E. 567, 1931 Va. LEXIS 248 (1931); Ruff v. Gathright, 373 F. Supp. 232, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (W.D. Va. 1974). Confession by accused is a jury qu estion.  In a prosecution for a violation of former § 4-57, it was held that the question as to whether a confession was made by accused was for the jury and was by the ir verdict resolved adversely to the accused. Upshur v. Commonwealth, 170 Va. 649, 197 S.E. 435, 1938 Va. LEXIS 220 (1938). As is the credib ility of testimony of an accomplice.  In a prosecution for the unlawful manufacture of ardent spirits and possession of equipment for such manufacture under former § 4-57, the credibility of the te stimony of an accomplice was a question for the jury. Upshur v. Commonwealth, 170 Va. 649, 197 S.E. 435, 1938 Va. LEXIS 220 (1938). Evidence held sufficient to sustain conviction of illegal manufacture. Strange v. Common wealth, 182 Va. 742, 30 S.E.2d 552, 1944 Va. LEXIS 228 (1944). Evidence sustained conviction for an attempt to manufacture illegally alcoholic beverage s. Anderson v.

System whereby Virginia wineries, farm wineries, breweries, and off-premises licensees could directly ship beer and wine to Virginia and out-of-state consumers, w here legal, but out-of-state vendors could neither obtain a Virginia license nor directly ship beer or wine to Virginia consumers, was the very definition of a facially discriminatory law; statutes were unconstitutional forms of discrimination in their i n-state preferences for Virginia wine and beer.

Constitutionality.  Virginias ban on the direct shipment of wine to Virginia consumers from out-of-state entities, while Virginia not only permits, but encourages, direct shipmen t to consumers by in-state wineries and farm wineries, violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional.

The record on appeal did not support a theory of conspiracy to racially discriminate whe re the record consisted solely of a naked allegation of a percentage of black arrests under former § 4-58. Butler v. Cooper, 554 F.2d 645, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 13370 (4th Cir. 1977). Impeachment of witness.  In a prosecution under former § 4-58 the usual restrictive rules of evidence relating to the methods which may be used to impeach the truth and veracity of a w itness were applicable to an undercover agent for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (now Board) who was the primary witness against defendant. Clark v. Commonwealth, 202 Va. 787, 120 S.E.2d 270, 1961 Va. LEXIS 179 (1961). Hearsay evidence.  In prosecution under former § 4-58 admission of hearsay evidence was held to be reversible error. Boatright v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 753, 96 S.E.2d 772, 1957 V a. LEXIS 135 (1957). Burden of proof.  In a prosecution under former § 4-58 there was no burden upon the Commonwealth to show that the defendant did not have a license. Baughan v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 28, 141 S.E.2d 750, 1965 Va. LEXIS 164 (1965). Instructions.  See Boatright v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 753, 96 S.E.2d 772, 1957 Va. LEXIS 135 (1957). In a prosecution under former § 4-58, since there was no evidence tending to show that investigators for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (now Board), to whom defendant sold whiskey, conceived or planned to procure the illegal sales by one who would not otherwise have made them, there was no basis for giving defendants requested instruction on entrapment. Swift v. Commonwealth, 199 Va. 420, 100 S. E.2d 9, 1957 Va. LEXIS 206 (1957). Sufficiency of evidence.  On the trial of a warrant charging the unlawful sale of alcoholic beverages the evidence was held sufficient to sustain the verdict of guilty. Simpson v. Commonwe alth, 199 Va. 549, 100 S.E.2d 701, 1957 Va. LEXIS 224 (1957). Where the record contained testimony by the investigators of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (now Board) to whom defendant had sold whiskey, that he was not properly licensed, there was no merit to his contention on appeal that the Commonwealth had failed to prove this fact. Swift v. Commonwealth, 199 Va. 420, 100 S.E.2d 9, 1957 Va. LEXIS 206 (1957). Evidence held sufficient to justify verdict of guilty in prosecution for illegal sale of intoxicating liquor. Nicholas v.

Former § 4-71 was not applicable to officer of Board acting within scope of employment.  An officer of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (now Board) who ascertains that a person is equipped to make illegal sales of whiskey and buys whiskey fro m that person is a feigned accomplice, who, when he acts strictly within the scope of his employment, is not an accomplice in the sense that his uncorroborated testimony will not support a conviction, nor in the sense that his testimony should be condemned as unworthy of belief by the trial judge by an instruction that the jury must act upon it with caution. Guthrie v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 461, 198 S.E. 481, 1938 Va. LEXIS 299 (1938) (decided under prior law). An d testimony of such officer as to purchase was admissible.  In a prosecution under the former Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, the only evidence for the Commonwealth consisted in the testimony of an inspector of the Alcohol ic Beverage Control Commission (now Board), who testified that he bought whiskey from accused and introduced a bottle of whiskey which he asserted he had purchased from accused. It was held that the evidence of the officer was admissible and, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to sustain a conviction. Guthrie v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 461, 198 S.E. 481, 1938 Va.

Some of the cases noted below were decided under former § 4-62, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. No constructive noti ce of order of interdiction.  The seller is not charged with constructive notice of the publication made under former § 4-51 (now § 4.1-333). He must have actual notice of the interdicti on. Calamos v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 397, 35 S.E.2d 397, 1945 Va. LEXIS 159 (1945). Reason to believe pu rchaser interdicted.  The failure of the seller before making the sale to inquire of the purchaser whether the latter had been interdicted is no indication that the seller had reason t o believe that the purchaser was an interdicted person. Calamos v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 397, 35 S.E.2d 397, 1945 Va. LEXIS 159 (1945). Circumstances were not sufficient to charge seller with reason to believe that the person to whom he sold had been interdicted. Calamos v. Commonwealth, 1 84 Va. 397, 35 S.E.2d 397, 1945 Va. LEXIS 159 (1945). Seller not guilty of contempt for violation of interdiction order.  A seller of intoxicants who had no actual knowledge or notice of an interdiction order entered against the purchaser cannot be held in contempt for violating such order. Calamos v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 397, 35 S.E.2d 397, 1945 Va. LEXIS 159 (1945). As to meaning of intoxicated, see Gardner v. Commonwealth, 195 Va. 945, 81 S.E.2 d 614, 1954 Va. LEXIS 172 (1954). Duty to gauge level of i ntoxication of patrons.  As sellers, restaurant employees are charged with gauging the level of intoxication in their patrons; their failure to do so does not absolve the restaurant of th e obligations of its license application. Sights &amp; Brightwaters Investors, Ltd. v. Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Bd., 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 550 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 27, 1998). Evidence sufficient to est ablish violation.  Employees of the restaurant had reason to believe that the patron was intoxicated, based on the patrons antagonistic and argumentative demeanor and the amount of alcohol consumed by him over the course of an evening. Sights &amp; Brightwaters Investors, Ltd. v. Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Bd., 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 550 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 27, 1998). Where a store relied to its detriment on subpoenas issued to witnesses (who failed to appear) by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board and conceded that the Board had sufficient evidence to find an alcoholic beverage license violation, the store was not denied due process. 7-11, Inc. v. Va. Alcoholic Bev. Control Bd., 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 324 (Va. Ct. App. June 3, 2003). At an administrative hearing at which a retailer was charged with selling alcohol to a minor, the evidence was sufficient to establish the retailers violation of § 4.1-304 and 3 VAC 5-50-10 as the only identification card the minor had when he entered the retailers store indicated he was 17, he gave the card to the retailers employee, and the employee, after looking at it, sold the minor beer, and the clerk admitted looking at the card and miscalculating the minors age due to blurred vision and anxiety about a long line of waiting customers. Mirabile Corp. v. Va. Alcoholic Bev. Control Bd., 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 493 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2003) . Because a licensee stood in the shoes of its employee who served alcohol to an underage subject in violation of § 4.1-304 and 3 VAC 5-50-10, the licensee commi tted a violation cognizable under subdivision 1 c of § 4.1-225, which triggered the sanctions set forth therein. Commodore Assocs. v. Va. Alcoholic Bev. Control Bd., 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 68 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 10, 2009). Customers hearsay evidence that a patron appeared intoxicated while in a liquor store, and that the customer informed a cashier that the patron appeared intox icated, but the cashier continued to ring up the patrons purchase was substantial evidence of a § 4.1-304 violation, particularly in light of a police officers observations of signs of intoxication after the patrons car accident. R K Enter s. v. Va. Alcoholic Bev. Control Bd., 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 284 (Va. Ct. App. June 23, 2009). Attorney General not proper defendant for injunctive relief.  The mere fact that the Attorney General is clothed with enforcement power by former § 2.1-124 (see now § 2.2-511) does not warrant making him a defendant fo r purposes of injunctive relief against enforcement of former § 4-62, where the plaintiff did not assert any actual threatened enforcement by the Attorney General nor cite any history of prior enforcement of former § 4-62 by the Attorney General ag ainst himself or others. Fisher v. Coleman, 486 F. Supp. 311, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9708 (W.D. Va. 1979), aff'd, 639 F.2d 191, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 20650 (4th Cir. 1981), overruled, Manning v. Caldwell, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019). Former § 4-62 and the Virginia common law did not recognize dram shop liability on th e part of a person who purveys an alcoholic beverage to someone else who then causes a tort to occur, specifically an automobile accident, while that person was intoxicated. Webb v. Blackie's House of Beef, Inc., 811 F.2d 840, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 2346 ( 4th Cir. 1987). In view of the fact that Virginia does not recognize dram shop liability, the federal government could not be found liable for negligence on such a legal principl e arising out of an automobile accident caused by an intoxicated 19-year-old Army private who had done his drinking at taverns operated by the Army. Corrigan v. United States, 815 F.2d 954, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 4105 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 926 , 108 S. Ct. 290, 98 L. Ed. 2d 250, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 4575 (1987). Former § 4-62 did not create cause of action against seller by third party.  Former § 4-62 was a part of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, a self-contained statute with its own penalty provisions enacted solely with the legis lative intent to regulate the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages. It did not create a cause of action against the seller of alcoholic beverages by a third party for the negligent acts of a patron. Webb v. Regua Ltd. Partnership, 624 F. Supp. 47 1, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12268 (E.D. Va. 1985), aff'd, 811 F.2d 840, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 2346 (4th Cir. 1987). A person injured by an intoxicated customer of a seller of intoxicants is not a member of the class for whose benefit former § 4-62 was enacted. Thus, violatio n of former § 4-62 did not constitute negligence per se and does not furnish the basis for a civil action in damages. Williamson v. Old Brogue, Inc., 232 Va. 350, 350 S.E.2d 621, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1325, 1986 Va. LEXIS 264 (1986). A third party does not have a claim for relief against seller of intoxicating beverages for injuries sustained as a result of the intoxication of the vendors patron, even if the patron is a minor. Byrd v. Gate Petro. Co., 845 F.2d 86, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 5445 (4th Cir. 1988). In Virginia there is no liability on seller of intoxicating liquor for negligence, resulting in personal injuries sustained by third parties, as a result of the negligence of the patron after leaving the sellers establishment. Webb v. Regua Ltd. Partnership, 624 F. Supp. 471, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12268 (E.D. Va. 1985), aff'd, 811 F.2d 840, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 2346 (4th Cir. 1987).

Such person may be prosecuted either in the county or city in which the alcohol was possessed or consumed, or in the county or city in which the person exhibits evidence of physical indicia of consumption of alcohol. It shall be an affirmative defense to a charge of a violation of this subsection if the defendant shows that such consumption or possession was pursuant to subdivision 7 of § 4.1-200. B. No person u nder the age of 21 years shall use or attempt to use any (i) altered, fictitious, facsimile, or simulated license to operate a motor vehicle; (ii) altered, fictitious, facsimile, or simulated document, including but not limited to a birth certificate or student identification card; or (iii) motor vehicle drivers license or other document issued under Chapter 3 (§ 46.2-300 et seq.) of Title 46.2 or the comparable law of another jurisdiction, birth certificate, or student identification card of ano ther person in order to establish a false identification or false age for himself to consume, purchase, or attempt to consume or purchase an alcoholic beverage. C. Any person found guilty of a violation of this section is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor, and upon conviction (i) such person shall be ordered to pay a mandatory minimum fine of $500 or ordered to perform a mandatory minimum of 50 hours of community service as a c ondition of probation supervision and (ii) the license to operate a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth of any such person age 18 or older shall be suspended for a period of not less than six months and not more than one year; the license to operate a moto r vehicle in the Commonwealth of any juvenile shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of § 16.1-278.9. The court, in its discretion and upon a demonstration of hardship, may authorize an adult convicted of a violation of this section the us e of a restricted license to operate a motor vehicle in accordance with the provisions of subsection E of § 18.2-271.1 or when referred to a local community-based probation services agency established pursuant to Article 9 (§ 9.1-173 et seq.) of Ch apter 1 of Title 9.1. During the period of license suspension, the court may require an adult who is issued a restricted license under the provisions of this subsection to be (a) monitored by an alcohol safety action program or (b) supervised by a local community-based probation services agency established pursuant to Article 9 (§ 9.1-173 et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 9.1, if one has been established for the locality. The alcohol safety action program or local community-based probation services agen cy shall report to the court any violation of the terms of the restricted license, the required alcohol safety action program monitoring or local community-based probation services and any condition related thereto or any failure to remain alcohol-free d uring the suspension period. D. Any alcohol ic beverage purchased or possessed in violation of this section shall be deemed contraband and forfeited to the Commonwealth in accordance with § 4.1-338. E. Any retail licensee who in good faith promptly notifies the Board or any state or local law-enforcement agency of a violation or suspected violation of this section shall be accorded immunity from an administrative penalty for a violation of § 4.1-304. F. When any ad ult who has not previously been convicted of underaged consumption, purchase or possession of alcoholic beverages in Virginia or any other state or the United States is before the court, the court may, upon entry of a plea of guilty or not guilty, if the facts found by the court would justify a finding of guilt of a violation of subsection A, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, defer further proceedings and place him on probation subject to appropriate conditions. S uch conditions may include the imposition of the license suspension and restricted license provisions in subsection C.

The possession contemplated by this section is a guilty possession and the accused must have a connection with the ownership. Sutherland v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 485, 198 S.E. 452, 1938 Va. LEXIS 302 (1938); Fairfax v. Commonwealth, 177 Va. 824, 13 S.E.2d 315, 1941 Va. LEXIS 261 (1941). Both p ossession and want of stamps or seals must be proved.  Both the fact of possession and the further fact that the spirits have no legal stamps or seals thereon must be proved. Sutherland v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 485, 1 98 S.E. 452 (1938); Saunders v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 100, 16 S.E.2d 383 (1941), wherein the essential fact of possession was proven . And possession cannot be presumed.  The fact of possession must be proved and is not presumed. Sutherland v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 485, 198 S.E. 452, 1938 Va. LEXIS 302 (1938). The presence of liquor upon the premises of the owner or occupant is not sufficient, in the absence of statute, to overcome the presumption of innocence. Sutherland v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 485, 198 S.E. 452, 1938 Va. LEXIS 302 (1938); Pardue v. Commonwealth, 183 Va. 277, 32 S.E.2d 77, 1944 Va. LEXIS 151 (1944). The presence of the liquor in the home is undoubtedly a suspicious circumstance but of itself is not enough to justify a conviction. Sutherland v. Commonwealth, 1 71 Va. 485, 198 S.E. 452, 1938 Va. LEXIS 302 (1938); Fairfax v. Commonwealth, 177 Va. 824, 13 S.E.2d 315, 1941 Va. LEXIS 261 (1941). The mere finding of liquor upon the premises occupied by accused and another created no presumption of law that accused was in the possession of it, either indivi dually, or jointly with such other person. Powers v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 669, 30 S.E.2d 22, 1944 Va. LEXIS 219 (1944). Wifes careless failure to keep all of her whiskey locked up was held insufficient to make husband guilty. Fairfax v. Commonwealth, 177 Va. 824, 13 S.E.2d 315, 1941 Va. LEXIS 261 (1941); Saunders v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 100, 16 S.E.2d 383, 1941 Va. LEXIS 147 (1941). Nor is the presence of a person in an automobile in which liquor is transported.  The mere presence of a person in an automobile in which intoxicating liquor is being illegally transported, with or without his knowledge, which is not shown to b e owned by him or under his possession or control, single or joint, is not a crime, nor is it made by statute prima facie evidence of his transportation of or aiding or abetting the transportation of the intoxicating liquor in the automobile, nor is it a lone sufficient to sustain a conviction of him upon a charge of illegally transporting intoxicating liquor. Worsham v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 192, 34 S.E.2d 234, 1945 Va. LEXIS 141 (1945). Burden of showing that whiskey was being transported in interstate commerce.  In a prosecution for violating former § 4-75, the burden of showing that the whiskey is being transported in interstate commerce is upon the accused. Whitaker v. Commonwealth, 170 Va. 621, 195 S.E. 486, 1938 Va. LEXIS 216 (1938). Effect of storing and breaking original packages.  In a prosecution for violation of former § 4-75, cases of unstamped whiskey, two of which had been opened and bottles removed therefrom and distributed, were f ound in accuseds automobile on his premises. Accused claimed that the whiskey was being transported in interstate commerce, and accuseds nephew stated that the whiskey had been purchased by him in Kentucky for delivery in Florida and that accused had no knowledge that the whiskey was in the automobile. It was held that even if the shipment were interstate originally, the interstate character was changed by the storing of the liquor in accuseds car and breaking the original packages. When the cases were broken and the bottles of whiskey removed and distributed, this destroyed the immunity, if it had ever been an interstate shipment. Whitaker v. Commonwealth, 170 Va. 621, 195 S.E. 486, 1938 Va. LEXIS 216 (1938). Sufficiency of evidence.  See Smith v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 585, 30 S.E.2d 26, 1944 Va. LEXIS 208 (1944); Pardue v. Commonwealth, 183 Va. 277, 32 S.E.2d 77, 1944 Va. LEXIS 151 (1944); Wor sham v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 192, 34 S.E.2d 234, 1945 Va. LEXIS 141 (1945); Sturgis v. Commonwealth, 197 Va. 264, 88 S.E.2d 919, 1955 Va. LEXIS 219 (1955). Remand of case.  Where the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the verdict of the jury set aside, and the Commonwealth has apparently fully developed its evidence, the cas e will be remanded to the trial court, with the direction to dismiss the accused from further prosecution under the charge in the warrant.

The cases noted below were decided under former § 4-77, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. Use of still not nec essary to support conviction.  The possession of a still constituted an offense under former § 4-77, regardless of whether or not it was used in the manufacturing of ardent spirits. So the r efusal of an instruction to the effect that it must be so used was proper. Hawkins v. Commonwealth, 138 Va. 751, 120 S.E. 854, 1924 Va. LEXIS 66 (1924). Finding still within dwelling.  An instruction that distilling apparatus found within ones dwelling is presumed to be the property of the person occupying the premises, would be misleading a nd improper, except when relied upon in a prosecution against an occupant of the premises. Hudgins v. Commonwealth, 142 Va. 628, 128 S.E. 565, 1925 Va. LEXIS 366 (1925). Finding upon premises as possession.  Where stills, still sites, barrels of mash, and apparatuses used in the manufacturing of ardent spirits are found on the premises of the accused, together with so me incriminating evidence, they are held sufficient to support a conviction of the accused of the possession of stills and appliances, etc. This is true even though there is evidence contradicting such possession.

Some of the cases noted below were decided under former § 4-81, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. Commonwealth must establish two distinct facts for conviction.  Before a conviction can be sustained under former § 4-81, it is necessary for the Commonwealth to establish two separate and distinct facts. First, that alcoho lic beverages were habitually used upon the premises contrary to law, and, second, that the defendant maintained, aided, abetted, or knowingly was associated with another in such unlawful use. St. Clair v. Commonwealth, 174 Va. 480, 5 S.E.2d 512, 1939 Va . LEXIS 169 (1939); Crowe v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 752, 71 S.E.2d 77, 1952 Va. LEXIS 187 (1952); Luttrell v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 774, 160 S.E.2d 757, 1968 Va. LEXIS 181 (1968). Beyond a reasonable doubt.  The essential elements necessary to sustain a conviction under former § 4-81 must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. Crowe v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 752, 71 S.E.2d 77, 1952 Va. LEXIS 187 (1952). A device for dispensing whiskey to persons who contribute a sufficient sum for juke box music is a subterfuge outlawed by former § 4-81. McCullough v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 26, 27 S.E.2d 904, 1943 Va. LEXIS 127 (1943). Admissibility of evidence.  The evidence for the Commonwealth was that the home of accused was visited at various times by men and women, that some entered the home sober and left it drunk, others were intoxicated when they came and left in an intoxicated condition, and that some left carrying small packages. It was held that this class of evidence was admissible and was a circumstance to be considered, but it was only one of many circumsta nces to be considered by the jury in determining the guilt of accused. Woods v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 543, 199 S.E. 465, 1938 Va. LEXIS 310 (1938). Evidence held sufficient.  While the evidence tending to establish the guilt of accused was circumstantial, considered as a whole it was sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty. Woods v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 543, 199 S.E. 465, 1938 Va. LEXIS 310 (1938). The evidence showed that the premises were so conducted that parties entering could first be surveyed by the inmates, a number of bottles of distilled spirits and beer were found on the premises, several of the people in the house were under the influence of liquor, and for some time prior to the search visitors to the house entered sober and came out in such an intoxicated condition that they were arrested for d runkenness. It was held that the evidence was conclusive that accused was the operator of what is commonly termed a nip joint. Smith v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 480, 198 S.E. 432, 1938 Va. LEXIS 301 (1938). In a prosecution for maintaining a common nuisance by dispensing alcoholic beverages in violation of former § 4-81, it was held that the evidence showed the gu ilt of accused. McCullough v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 26, 27 S.E.2d 904, 1943 Va. LEXIS 127 (1943). Evidence held insufficient.  In a prosecution for maintaining a common nuisance as defined by former § 4-81, it was held that the evidence was not sufficient to establish beyond a reasonab le doubt that alcoholic beverages were dispensed or otherwise used on the premises contrary to law. St. Clair v. Commonwealth, 174 Va. 480, 5 S.E.2d 512, 1939 Va. LEXIS 169 (1939). Evidence held insufficient to sustain a conviction for maintaining a common nuisance under former § 4-81. Dudley v. Commonwealth, 174 Va. 466, 5 S.E.2d 473, 19 39 Va. LEXIS 166 (1939); Crowe v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 752, 71 S.E.2d 77, 1952 Va. LEXIS 187 (1952). In a prosecution under former § 4-81, evidence that the officers observed a number of persons visiting the home on one Sunday, and that some of them were drink ing, tended to create a suspicion that the building may have been, in common parlance, a nip joint, but this testimony alone was not sufficient to produce the full assurance of moral certainty that whiskey was illegally dispensed or used on the premises. St. Clair v. Commonwealth, 174 Va. 480, 5 S.E.2d 512, 1939 Va. LEXIS 169 (1939). In a prosecution for maintaining a common nuisance in violation of former § 4-81, police officers found in accuseds home 12 pints of whiskey properly seale d and stamped, and three witnesses for the Commonwealth testified that they lived close to the accused but had never been in his home; that they had never seen any whiskey taken in or away from his home or sold there; that they had never heard any unusua l noise or commotion there, but that more than the usual number of automobiles stopped in front of the accuseds home and that people went in and out, some carrying packages. It was held that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a judgment of conv iction. Campbell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 448, 187 S.E. 502, 1936 Va. LEXIS 304 (1936). Where the evidence showed a large number of people visiting defendants home, including repeat visitors on the same day, the short length of the visits, the re putation of some visitors as drunks, and the presence of substantial quantities of whiskey in pint bottles of various brands on the premises, but no complaints of disturbance or disorder against defendants or the premises, and the evidence was not suffic ient to show the whiskey was illegal, or disbursed, or used on the premises, the evidence was not sufficient for court or jury to declare the residence a common nuisance. Luttrell v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 774, 160 S.E.2d 757, 1968 Va. LEXIS 181 (1968). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Civil liability.  Student did not sufficiently allege that the fraternity members could be held liable for negligence per se under this section because the Virginia Supreme Court h ad previously found that a violation of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, of which this section fell within, did not give rise to civil liability.

Most of the cases noted below were decided under former § 4-83, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. Former section was applicable to the officers of the law, and when they arm themselves a nd unlawfully transport ardent spirits, they are subject to the penalty. Hall v. Commonwealth, 143 Va. 554, 130 S.E. 416, 1925 Va. LEXIS 290 (1925). Manufacture as herein defined refers to the entire act, including the legislativ ely created definition of manufacture contained in former § 4-57 (d) (see now § 4.1-300). Ruff v. Gathright, 373 F. Supp. 232, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (W.D. Va. 1974). Actual manufacturing does not have to be established to prove a violation of former § 4-83. Ruff v. Gathright, 373 F. Supp. 232, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (W.D. Va. 1974). Possession of a firearm need not be exclusive, and if the weapon is in the immediate are a and subject to dominion and control, there is constructive possession. Ruff v. Gathright, 373 F. Supp. 232, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (W.D. Va. 1974). Sufficiency of indictment.  An indictment which charges unlawful manufacture in one count and the possession of a dangerous weapon while so engaged in another, though loosely drawn, substant ially follows the statute. If the second count had not referred to the first, it would probably have been held that it failed to follow the statute, making the gravamen the possession. Edens v. Commonwealth, 142 Va. 609, 128 S.E. 555, 1925 Va. LEXIS 364 (1925).

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Brand name.  Title 4.1 does not define brand name, nor has the Board defined this term in its regulations. In the context of wine labels, Virginia Alcoholic Beverage C ontrol Authority appears to be using the term brand name synonymously with the term brand, as that term is defined by the Virginia Code. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Richard L. Saslaw, Member, Senate of Virginia, 18-061, 2 019 Va. AG LEXIS 32 (11/15/19).

The Supreme Courts Changing Stance on Cruel and Unusual Punishment, see 104 Va. L. Rev. 547 (2018). CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  This section does not violate the Eighth Amendment by imposing criminal punishment for the status of being an alcoholic nor did it violate the Equal Protection Cl ause of the Fourteenth Amendment by treating homeless alcoholics disparately; further, because defendant failed to present evidence that he was homeless, he lacked standing to challenge the statute based on this classification. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 4 4 Va. App. 218, 604 S.E.2d 122, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 514 (2004). Equal protection challenge to interdiction statutes failed, as the Commonwealth had a legitimate interest in discouraging alcohol and drug abuse, and it could not be said that preventing the possession or consumption of alcohol by individuals that admittedly could not mitigate their alcohol consumption or who had been adjudged to be at risk of abusing alcohol through interdiction proceedings, was not rationally r elated to this legitimate interest. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd, 900 F.3d 139, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 22163 (4th Cir. 2018), rev'd, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019). Vagueness challenge to interdiction statute failed because the statute contained explicit standards that law enforcement had to apply to prevent arbitrary and dis criminatory enforcement and put plaintiffs on reasonable notice as to the proscribed conduct. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd, 900 F.3d 139, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 22163 (4th Cir. 2018), rev'd, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019). Consumption prongs of interdiction statutes did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. VIII, as they did not punish the status of being a homeless alcoholic but rather punished the act of possessing or consuming alcohol, regardless of whether that possession or consumption was in public. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd, 900 F.3d 139, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 22163 (4th Cir. 2018), rev'd, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019). Sentence imposed was not dis proportionate.  Given defendants long history of arrests and continued failure to abide by the interdiction order, a 90-day jail sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the crime committed. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 218, 604 S.E.2d 122, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 514 (2004). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Constitutionality.  Because interdicted alcoholics were not a protected class, the Equal Protection Clause was not implicated; the charge under § 4.1-322 would not be dismissed si nce defendant was not facing criminal sanction for his mere status, but because he was drunk in public on a particular occasion. Commonwealth v. Reyes, 72 Va. Cir. 105, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 279 (Alexandria Sept. 19, 2006). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Preliminary breath tests may be admissible.  The results of the preliminary breath tests (Alco-Sensor or like device) may be admissible for the offenses of underage possession of alcohol, possession or consu mption of alcoholic beverages by an interdicted person, and public intoxication at the discretion of the trial judge and subject to the proper foundation.

Autrefo is, Acquit and Convict, § 7; 3A M.J. Bigamy, §§ 2, 3.10B M.J. Intoxicating Liquors, § 48. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases noted below were decided under former § 4-87, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. Effect of section as to attempts.  The effect of former § 4-87 is to write into each indictment charging unlawful manufacture of intoxicants the charge of an attempt, and the consummated crime a nd the attempt by statute stand upon exactly the same footing and the punishment in each instance is the same. Trent v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1128, 156 S.E. 567, 1931 Va. LEXIS 289 (1931). While the courts must exercise judgment and discretion in construing any doubtful provisions of the prohibition act, the terms of the statute leave no room to dou bt that any willful attempt to violate the law in any substantial particular must be regarded as a crime, and punishable accordingly. In other words, whenever a conviction ought to be sustained if the offense had been consummated, a conviction for conduc t which in law amounts to an attempt to commit the same offense should be sustained. Collins v. City of Radford, 134 Va. 518, 113 S.E. 735, 1922 Va. LEXIS 174 (1922). No evidence of attempt.  Accused drove up to still to get whiskey and was told that none was ready, but that he should wait. While he was waiting the still was raided. It was held that th ere was not evidence to convict the accused of an attempt to transport, the direct act toward its commission not having been committed. Andrews v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 451, 115 S.E. 558, 1923 Va. LEXIS 25 (1923). But see Collins v. City of Radford, 134 Va. 518, 113 S.E. 735, 1922 Va. LEXIS 174 (1922). Effect where princip al guilty of prior offenses.  While it is true that the general rule is that an accessory is amenable to the same punishment as the principal, this general rule is not applicable to one aiding and abetting a principal who has been guilty of prior offenses. In derogation of the general rule this fixes the status of an aider or abettor and provides that the punishment shall be the same as if the defendant were solely guilty of such violation. S eay v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1087, 156 S.E. 574, 1931 Va. LEXIS 285 (1931). Accused held not principal or acce ssory.  Accused by taking two drinks from a bottle tendered him by a companion in an automobile did not become guilty of the offense of transporting the liquor as a princ ipal in the second degree upon the principle that, being present, he aided and abetted the act. His conduct in drinking from the bottle may have indicated an approval of what they had done and were continuing to do, but it cannot be fairly said to have c onstituted him a participant in the transportation either as a principal or an accessory.

CASE NOTES Search and seizure.  Termination of a special agent with the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control was appropriate because the agent violated the constitutional rights of an applicant for a retail alcohol license by searching the applicants business office in back of a restaurant during a site visit without the applicants knowledge or consent. The exception for warrantless inspections of businesses engaged in high ly regulated industries was not applicable because prior to licensure, applicants for licenses were not subject to the warrantless searches.

For note, Is Powell Still Valid? The Supreme Courts Changing Stance on Cruel and Unusual Punishment, see 104 Va. L. Rev. 547 (2018). CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases noted below were decided under former § 4-51, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. The term habitual drunkard clearly encompasses one who is admittedly in the continual habit of being intoxicated from alcohol. Fisher v. Coleman, 486 F. Supp. 311, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9708 (W.D. Va. 1979), aff'd, 639 F.2d 191, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 20650 (4th Cir. 1981), overruled, Manning v. Caldwell, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019). Plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the interdiction provisions of this section on vagueness and overbreadth grounds in light of his 59 convictions for public drunkenness over a period of slightly more than two years prior to his interdiction, which conduct fell clearly within the challenged language. Fisher v. Coleman, 639 F.2d 191, 198 1 U.S. App. LEXIS 20650 (4th Cir. 1981), overruled, Manning v. Caldwell, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019). A person who had 59 convictions of public drunkenness during a period of slightly over two years and whose counselor at the local alcoholic treatment center descr ibed him as an incorrigible public drunkard was without standing to allege that the term habitual drunkard, as used in this section governing interdiction of habitual drunkards, was void for vagueness, since claims of overbreadth and vagueness ma y not be brought by persons whose actions fall clearly within the terms of the statute in question. Fisher v. Coleman, 486 F. Supp. 311, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9708 (W.D. Va. 1979), aff'd, 639 F.2d 191, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 20650 (4th Cir. 1981), overrule d, Manning v. Caldwell, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019). Application of section unconst itutional.  District court erred in dismissing action brought by plaintiff homeless alcoholics challenging Virginia statutory scheme that made it criminal offense for those w hom Commonwealth had labelled habitual drunkards to possess, consume, or purchase alcohol because challenged schemes use of term habitual drunkard was unconstitutionally vague, and even if it could be narrowed to apply only to similarly situa ted alcoholics, plaintiffs stated claim that it violated Eighth Amendment as applied to them; decision in Fisher v. Coleman , 639 F.2d 191 (4th Cir. 1981) affirming constitutionality of Virginia scheme was expressly overruled. Manning v. Caldwell, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019). Application of section n ot unconstitutional.  Although former § 4-51, governing interdiction of habitual drunkards, did not precisely define the term habitual drunkard, it was not unconstitutionall y vague as applied to a particular person, in light of that persons admitted alcoholism for 14 years and 59 convictions of public drunkenness in slightly more than two years, and his failure to make efforts to respond to court-ordered medical treatme nt, especially where he made no contention that had the statutes coverage been known to him, he would have acted differently. Fisher v. Coleman, 486 F. Supp. 311, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9708 (W.D. Va. 1979), aff'd, 639 F.2d 191, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 2 0650 (4th Cir. 1981), overruled, Manning v. Caldwell, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019). Section 4.1-322 did not violate the Eighth Amendment by imposing criminal punishment for the status of being an alcoholic nor did it violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by treating homeless alcoholics disparately; further, because defendant failed to present evidence that he was homeless, he lacked standing to challenge the statute based on this classification. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 218, 604 S.E.2d 122, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 514 (2004). Equal protection challenge to interdiction statutes failed, as the Commonwealth had a legitimate interest in discouraging alcohol and drug abuse, and it could not be said that preventing the possession or consumption of alcohol by individuals that admittedly could not mitigate their alcohol consumption or who had been adjudged to be at risk of abusing alcohol through interdiction proceedings, was not rationally r elated to this legitimate interest. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd, 900 F.3d 139, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 22163 (4th Cir. 2018), rev'd, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019). Plaintiffs failed to state a due process claim because civil interdiction hearings did not deprive them of their physical liberty and, even if it did, the Due Pro cess Clause did not require appointment of counsel at the proceeding. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd, 900 F.3d 139, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 22163 (4th Cir. 2018), rev'd, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019). Although states may not criminalize status, they may criminalize actual behavior even when the individual alleged that addiction created a strong urge to engage i n a particular act; a provision that put a person on notice that future acts may result in criminal sanctions did not criminalize status because it did not criminalize anything, and it was the other Virginia provisions, not the statute, that imposed crim inal sanctions. Manning v. Caldwell, 900 F.3d 139, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 22163 (4th Cir.), vacated, 741 Fed. Appx. 937, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 31690 (4th Cir. 2018). Purpose of publication of order is to give actual notice.  There was nothing in either former § 4-51 or former § 4-62 (see now § 4.1-304) to indicate that the purpose of the publication of the order of interdicti on is other than to give notice to one who might actually see it. There is no suggestion that all persons selling alcoholic beverages are to be charged with notice of such publication irrespective of whether they may have seen it. Calamos v. Commonwealth , 184 Va. 397, 35 S.E.2d 397, 1945 Va. LEXIS 159 (1945).

B. The courts of equity shall have jurisdiction, and in every case where the bill charges, on the knowledge or belief of the complainant, and is sworn to by two reputable citizens, that alcoholic beverages are manufactured, stored, sold, dispensed, given away, or used in such house, building or other place described in § 4.1-317 contrary to the laws of the Commonwealth, an injunction shall be granted as soon as the bill is presented to the court. The injunction shall enjoin and restrain the owners, tenants, their agents, employees, servants, and any person connected with such house, building or other place, and all persons whomsoever from manufacturing, storing, selling, dispensing, giving away, or using alcoholic beverages on such premises.

Commonwealths and States Attorney, § 2. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases noted below were decided under former § 4-82, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. Former § 4-82 was not in conflict with subdivision 3 of former § 4-89 (see now subdivision 7 of § 4.1-200). Nicholas v. Commonwealth, 186 Va. 315, 42 S.E.2d 306, 1947 Va. LEXIS 155 (1947). The injunction is intended t o be preventive.  The injunction authorized by former § 4-82 was manifestly intended to be preventive rather than merely punitive. McCarron v. Commonwealth, 169 Va. 387, 193 S.E . 509, 1937 Va. LEXIS 185 (1937). The words exists, or is kept or maintained, as used in former § 4-82 had a de finite and clear meaning, and apply to an actual being, something, in fact, in existence, something continuing and not failing. McCarron v. Commonwealth, 169 Va. 387, 193 S.E. 509, 1937 Va. LEXIS 185 (1937). When nuisance abated before hearing.  The latter portion of former § 4-82, in providing for a continuation of the injunction, although the premises may not be unlawfully used at the time of the hea ring of the matured case, was manifestly intended to cover those cases where nuisances exist at the time of the institution of the suit, but have been abated before such hearing. Under such circumstances, the provision allows the court to give considerat ion to the attitude of those who had formerly created or permitted a nuisance, but had abated it only after the institution of legal proceedings. McCarron v. Commonwealth, 169 Va. 387, 193 S.E. 509, 1937 Va. LEXIS 185 (1937). Plea of former jeopardy held no defe nse.  A plea of former jeopardy based on a conviction under former § 4-58 (see now § 4.1-302) for an illegal sale of alcoholic liquor stated no defense to a prose cution for violating, by the same sale, an injunction issued under former § 4-82 against selling alcoholic liquors on certain premises.

The destruction shall be in the presence of at least one credible witness, and such witness shall join the officer in a sworn report of the seizure and destruction, to be made to the Board. The report shall set forth the grounds of the claim of forfeiture, the reasons for seizure and destruction, and a statement that, from facts within their own knowledge, the seizing officer and witn ess have no doubt whatever that the mash was intended for use in the unlawful distillation of spirits, or that the alcoholic beverages were intended for use in violation of this subtitle. C. Hearing and determination.  Upon the return of the warrant as provided in this section, the court shall fix a time not less than ten days, unless waived by the accused in writing, and not more than thirty days thereafter, for the hearing on such return to deter mine whether or not the articles seized, or any part thereof, were used or in any manner kept, stored or possessed in violation of this subtitle.At such hearing if no claimant appears, the court shall declare the articles seized forfeited to the Commonwe alth and, if such articles are not necessary as evidence in any pending prosecution, shall turn them over to the Board. Any person claiming an interest in any of the articles seized may appear at the hearing and file a written claim setting forth particu larly the character and extent of his interest. The court shall certify the warrant and the articles seized along with any claim filed to the circuit court to hear and determine the validity of such claim.If the evidence warrants, the court shall enter a judgment of forfeiture and order the articles seized to be turned over to the Board.

A record shall be made showing the amount issued in each case, to whom issued and the date when issued, and shall be kept in the offices of the State Health Commissioner and the Board. No charge shall be made to any patient for the alcoholic beverages supplied to him where they have been received from the Board pursuant to this section. Such alcoholic beverages shall be administered only upon approval of the patients physician.If the Board believ es that any foodstuffs forfeited to the Commonwealth and turned over to the Board in accordance with this section are usable, should not be destroyed and cannot be sold or whose sale would be impractical, it may give such foodstuffs to any institution in the Commonwealth and shall prefer a gift to the local jail or other local correctional facility in the jurisdiction where seizure took place. A record shall be made showing the nature of the foodstuffs and amount given, to whom given and the date when g iven, and shall be kept in the offices of the Board. History History.

The cases noted below were decided under former § 4-92, now repealed, which covered the same subject matter as this section. The bond authorized by former § 4-92 is intended as a precautionary measure to preven t future violations of the law by a convicted person who is likely to be guilty of such violations. But where a man of good character has violated one of the provisions of the act, and there is no evidence indicating that he is likely again to do so, it is not proper to require him to execute a bond conditioned that he will not violate any of the provisions of the act for the term of one year.

Commonwealth, 199 Va. 549, 100 S.E.2d 701, 1957 Va. LEXIS 224 (1957). Manner of introduction.  In a prosecution for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquors the Commonwealth inadvertently closed its evidence without proving alleged prior conviction of il legal transportation, and counsel for accused moved that the allegation be stricken. The trial court overruled the motion but indicated its readiness to instruct the jury that at that stage of the trial there was no evidence of such prior conviction. Aft er accused had taken the stand and testified in chief, and had been cross-examined, he was asked, over the objection of his counsel, whether he had been previously convicted in the trial justice court of illegal transportation, and he admitted that he ha d. It was held that the ruling of the trial court was correct in allowing proof of the prior conviction. Smith v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 585, 30 S.E.2d 26, 1944 Va. LEXIS 208 (1944). Evidence restricted to q uantum of punishment.  In a prosecution for maintaining a nuisance in violation of former § 4-81 (see now § 4.1-317), accused objected to the introduction of evidence of prior con victions of similar offenses and contended that such evidence, if allowed at all, should be limited to the measure of punishment in the event of his conviction of the offense for which he was being tried. It was held that the evidence should be restricte d to the quantum of punishment, since the terms of former section did not expressly make such evidence applicable to the case upon trial and it could not be said that its terms impliedly did so. Campbell v. Commonwealth, 176 Va. 564, 11 S.E.2d 577, 1940 Va. LEXIS 274 (1940). Instructions.  The refusal to instruct the jury that the fact that the defendant has been heretofore convicted of similar or like offenses is not proof that he is guilty of the offense here charged and such fact should not be considered by the jury in reaching a conclusion as to his guilt or innocence on the present charge, was prejudicial error. Campbell v. Commonwealth, 176 Va. 564, 11 S.E.2d 577, 1940 Va. LEXIS 274 ( 1940). The trial court should instruct the jury to the effect that evidence of a prior conviction was to be considered only as to the quantum of punishment and was not t o be considered as tending to prove the guilt of accused.

Law Rep. 1558, 1989 Va. LEXIS 24 (1989) (decided under former § 4.1-118.21). Purpose of Beer Franchise Act consistent with Wine Franchise Act.  The Beer Franchise Act, §§ 4.1-500 to 4.1-517, unlike the Wine Franchise Act, §§ 4.1-400 to 4.1-418, does not contain an enumeration of its underlying purposes or a statement of the standard by which its provisions are to be construed; nevertheless, the two Acts, which, except for their specific subject matter, are in every material respect similar, have the same general purposes and standard of const ruction, and accordingly, like the Wine Franchise Act, the Beer Franchise Act is to be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.

Act did not preempt conspiracy claims.  Virginia Wine Franchise Act did not preempt common-law or statutory conspiracy claims under § 18.2-499 by a wholesaler against a winery; a violation of the Act was covered by the Act, but a conspiracy to violate the Act was not. As the wholesaler had also brought an administrative proceeding before the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC Board), however, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction meant that the ABC Board should determine whether the wrongful acts underlying the conspiracy claims had occurred. Country Vintner, Inc. v. Louis Latour, Inc., 272 Va. 402, 634 S.E.2d 745, 2006 Va. LEXIS 86 (2006). Termination under the Beer Franc hise Act.  Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board erred in finding that a distributor agreement was terminated under the Beer Franchise Act, §§ 4.1-500 to 4.1-517, because the brewerys notice of intent to terminate was insufficient to trigger the termination of the agreement since the reasons given by the brewery for terminating the agreement were not specific enough to allow the distributor to determine whethe r the stated reasons related to conditions that could be cured within 60 days, much less allow the distributor to actually take steps to cure any such conditions.

The s hipment, preparation for shipment or acceptance of any order by a winery for any wine to a wine wholesaler within the Commonwealth. 2. The payment by a wine wholesaler and the acceptance of payment by any winery for the shipment of an order of wine intended for sale in the Commonwealth. Brand means any word, name, group of letters, symbol or combination thereof adopted an d used by a winery to identify a specific wine product and to distinguish that product from other wine produced or marketed by that winery or other wineries. The use of general corporate logos or symbols or the use of advertising messages, whether appear ing on the product packaging or elsewhere, shall not be considered to be a brand, brand extension, or part thereof as these terms are used in this chapter. Brand extension and extension of a brand mean any brand which incorporates all or a substantial part of the unique features of a preexisting brand of the same winery and which rel ies to a significant extent on the good will associated with such preexisting brand. Dual distributorships means the existence of agreements between a single winery and mo re than one wholesaler, each selling a different brand, in a given territory as the result of a purchase of another winery. Nonsurviving winery means any winery which is purchased by another winery as provided in § 4.1-405 and, as a result, ceases to exist as an independent legal entity. Person means a natural person, corporation, partnership, trust, agency or other entity as well as the individual officers, directors or other persons in active control of the activities of each such entity. Person also includes heirs, assigns, personal representatives and conservators. Purchase includes, but is not limited to, the sale of stock, sale of assets, merger, l ease, transfer or consolidation. Surviving winery means the winery which purchases a nonsurviving winery as provided in § 4.1-405. Territory or sales territory means the area of primary sales responsibility within the Commonwealth expressly or implicitly designated by any agreement between any wine wholesaler and winery for the brand or brands of any winery. Wine wholesaler means any wholesale wine licensee offering wine for sale or resale to retailers or other wine wholesalers without regard to whether the business of the person is conducted under the terms of an agreement with a licensed winery. Winery means every person, including any authorized representative of such person purs uant to § 4.1-218, which enters into an agreement with any Virginia wholesale wine licensee and (i) is licensed as a winery or is licensed as a Virginia farm winery, (ii) is licensed as a wine importer and is not simultaneously licensed as a wine whol esaler, (iii) manufactures or sells any wine products, whether licensed in the Commonwealth or not, or (iv) without regard to whether such person is licensed in the Commonwealth, has title to any wine products, excluding Virginia wholesale licensees and retail licensees, and has the manufacturers authorization to market such products under its own brand or the manufacturers brand.

The pu rchaser of a brand from a winery shall become obligated to all of the terms and conditions of the selling winerys agreements with wholesalers concerning that brand. Whenever such a purchase of a brand results in the creation of a dual distributorshi p, the provisions of subdivisions 1 and 2 of subsection B will determine the distribution rights to such brand or any extension thereof. For the limited purpose of making such determination, the winery selling the brand shall be a nonsurviving winery and the purchaser shall be a surviving winery. B.

In any case in which such a purchase of a winery by or on behalf of another winery has created or will create a dual distributorship, the following rules shall apply in order to determine the a llocation of any brands which are first marketed in the Commonwealth by the surviving winery after February 18, 1989: 1. If th e surviving winery distributes in the Commonwealth brands of the nonsurviving winery which that winery marketed anywhere prior to the purchase, these brands shall be distributed through any wholesalers who were distributors in the Commonwealth for the no nsurviving winery.

A copy of t he notice shall be mailed at the same time to the Board. If such condition has been rectified by action of the wholesaler, then the proposed amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal shall be void and without legal effect. However, where the win ery contends that action on the part of the wholesaler has not rectified one or more of such conditions, the winery must within fifteen days after the expiration of the sixty-day period request a hearing before the Board to determine if the condition has been rectified by action of the wholesaler. C. Where the r eason relates to a condition which may not be rectified by the wholesaler within the sixty-day period, the wholesaler may request a hearing before the Board to determine if there is good cause for the amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal of the agreement. D. Upon reques t in writing within the ninety-day period provided in subsection A from such winery or wholesaler for a hearing, the Board shall, after notice and hearing, determine if the action of the wholesaler has rectified the condition or, as the case may be, if g ood cause exists for the amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal of the agreement. E. In any proc eeding brought pursuant to this section in which the existence of good cause is an issue, the winery shall have the burden of proving the existence of good cause. Where a petition is made to the Board for a determination, the agreement in question shall continue in effect pending the Boards decision and any judicial review thereof, except in any case in which the Board makes a finding that there is good cause, as defined in § 4.1-406, for the amendment, termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal, i n which case the winery may, unless otherwise ordered by a court of record, discontinue the agreement in question. However, where a petition is made to the Board after the agreement has been terminated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section, the filing of the petition shall not cause the terminated agreement to be reinstated unless the terminated wholesalers failure to petition in a timely manner was based upon reasonable reliance on representation or other inducements made by t he winery. F. No notice s hall be required and an agreement may be immediately amended, terminated, cancelled or allowed to expire if the reason for the amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal is: 1. The b ankruptcy or receivership of the wholesaler; 2. An assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of the assets of the business, other than the creation of a security interest in the assets of a wholesaler for the pu rpose of securing financing in the ordinary course of business; or 3. Revocation of the wholesalers license. History History. Code 1950, § 4-118.28; 1985, c. 542, § 4-118.48; 1989, c. 1 0; 1993, c. 866; 1997, c. 183. Annotations Editors note.

Decision of the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control Board as to whether a wholesaler had exclusive rights to distribute a brewerys product in ce rtain counties had to be remanded because, (1) under §§ 4.1-500 and 4.1-503 and general inferences favoring the wholesaler, the Board should have presumed the wholesalers agreement with the brewery including counties listed on an attachment fil ed with the Board as designated sales territory, (2) it was unclear if the Board applied the presumption, and (3) if the Board applied the presumption, the Board did not state the decisions basic law, contrary to subsection E of § 2.2-4020.

Except for discontinuance of a brand or for good cause as provided in § 4.1-505, the purchaser of a brewery shall become obligated to all of the terms and conditions of the selling brewerys agreements with distributors in effect on the date of purchase. The purchaser of a brand from a brewery shall become obligated to all of the terms and conditions of the selling brewerys agreement with distributors concerning that brand. Whenever such a purchase of a brand results in the creation of a dual distribut orship, the provisions of subdivisions 1 and 2 of subsection B will determine the distribution rights to such brand or any extension thereof. For the limited purpose of making such determination, the brewery selling such brand shall be a nonsurviving bre wery and the purchaser shall be a surviving brewery. B. For purpose s of this section, when a purchase of a brewery by or on behalf of another brewery causes the selling brewery to cease to exist as an independent legal entity, the selling brewery shall be regarded as a nonsurviving brewery and the brewery on whose behal f the purchase was made shall be regarded as a surviving brewery. The following rules shall apply in order to determine (i) the distribution rights to any brands which are first marketed in the Commonwealth by the surviving brewery on or after July 1, 1 985, with respect to a dual distributorship created prior to July 1, 1985, and (ii) the distribution rights to any brands, regardless of when they were first marketed in the Commonwealth, with respect to a dual distributorship created on or after July 1, 1985: 1. If th e surviving brewery distributes in the Commonwealth any brand or brands of the nonsurviving brewery which that brewery marketed in the Commonwealth at any time during the one-year period ending on the day the purchase agreement was made, these brands sha ll be distributed through those beer wholesalers who were distributors in the Commonwealth for the nonsurviving brewery. Any brands which the surviving brewery had marketed in the Commonwealth prior to the purchase shall be distributed through those bee r wholesalers who were wholesalers of the surviving brewery prior to the purchase. 2. If the surviving brewery decides to market in the Commonwealth a new brand which is clearly an extension of a brand already assigned to beer wholesalers in the Commonwealth, the new br and shall be distributed through those wholesalers who distribute the brand of which the new brand is an extension. 3. If the surviving brewery decides to introduce in the Commonwealth a new brand which was not marketed in the Commonwealth at any time during the one-year period ending on the date the p urchase agreement was made and which is not a brand extension, the surviving brewery shall market the new brand either through a distributor of the nonsurviving brewery or through a distributor who was a distributor of the surviving brewery prior to the purchase, as the brewery may see fit in any territory. C. Subsection B shall not apply to determine distributorship rights to any brands or brand extensions which were marketed in the Commonwealth prior to July 1, 1985, with respect to any dual distributorship created prior to July 1, 1985.

In any determination as to whether a wholesaler has failed to substantially comply, without reasonable excuse or justification, with any reasonable and material requirement imposed upon him by the brewery, consideration shall be given to the relative size, population, geographical location, number of retail outlets and demand for the products applicable to the territory of the wholesaler in question and to comparable territories.

CASE NOTES Insufficient notice.  Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board erred in finding that a distributor agreement was terminated under the Beer Franchise Act, §§ 4.1-500 to 4.1-517, because the brewerys notice of intent to terminate was insufficient to trigger the termination of the agreement since the reasons given by the brewery for terminating the agreement were not specific enough to allow the distributor to determine whethe r the stated reasons related to conditions that could be cured within 60 days, much less allow the distributor to actually take steps to cure any such conditions.

Where the r eason relates to a condition or conditions which may be rectified by action of the wholesaler, he shall have sixty days in which to take such action and shall, within the sixty-day period, give written notice to the brewery if and when such action is tak en. A copy of the notice shall be mailed at the same time to the Board. If such condition has been rectified by action of the wholesaler, then the proposed amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal shall be void and without legal effect. However , where the brewery contends that action on the part of the wholesaler has not rectified one or more of such conditions the brewery shall within fifteen days after the expiration of such sixty-day period request a hearing before the Board to determine if the condition has been rectified by action of the wholesaler. C.

CASE NOTES Authority to conduct hearing regarding termination of distributorship agreement.  Where the record showed that: (1) despite having received a timely cure notice from a distributor, a brewery did not request a hearing with the ABC Board under su bsection B of § 4.1-506; (2) that, in failing to mail a copy of its cure notice to the ABC Board, the distributor also failed to comply with subsection B of § 4.1-506; (3) that the distributor did not request a hearing under subsection C or D of § 4.1-506; but (4) the brewery did request a hearing under subsection D of § 4.1-506, although the ABC Boards authority to conduct hearings and render a decision was not triggered by subsection B or C of § 4.1-506, the ABC Board had authorit y under subsection D of § 4.1-506 to hear and decide the parties dispute regarding their distributorship agreement because there was no provision in § 4.1-506 that indicated that the distributors compliance with the mailing requirement of s ubsection B of § 4.1-506 was a necessary prerequisite for adjudication by the ABC Board and there was no language in subsection D of § 4.1-506 that prohibited adjudication of the dispute by the ABC Board when only one of the parties to the agreemen t made a timely request for a hearing.

Sufficient notice of termination.  In requiring that the brewery state in the notice all the reasons for the intended termination, the legislature intended that the brewery identify the who lesalers deficiencies with sufficient specificity to allow the wholesaler to make the requisite determinations under subsections B and C of § 4.1-506 and to afford the wholesaler the opportunity to timely cure the asserted deficiencies, if possibl e. To permit a brewery to state in its notice only general, conclusory reasons for the intended termination would plainly contradict the manifest intention of the legislature expressed in § 4.1-506 and undermine the underlying purposes and policies of the Beer Franchise Act, §§ 4.1-500 to 4.1-517.

Reasonable compen sation shall include, but is not limited to, the following: 1. The f air market value of the assets used by the wholesaler specifically for the purpose of distributing the brewerys products; 2. The cost of the wholesalers inventory of the brewerys products calculated as the sum of the net price paid by the wholesaler for the inventory; 3. The amount of any taxes paid by the wholesaler in connection with purchasing the inventory; 4. The cost of transporting the inventory from the brewery to the wholesalers warehouse, plus any handling costs; and 5. The goodwill of the wholesalers business representing a value over and above the fair market value of the foregoing tangible assets.The compensation for such assets shall be subjec t to offset for (i) any sums recovered by the wholesaler in liquidation of the assets and (ii) the value which the assets have to the wholesaler independent of their value for use in distributing the brewerys products. B. In the even t the brewery and the beer wholesaler are unable to agree on the reasonable compensation to be paid for the value of the agreement, the matter shall be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators. The brewery and the beer wholesaler shall each select one arbitrator and the two arbitrators selected shall appoint a third arbitrator who shall be a person qualified by experience to appraise the value of existing businesses. The decision of the arbitrators shall be rendered within ninety days from the time t he matter is submitted to arbitration unless the Board, for good cause shown, allows for an extension of time not to exceed thirty days, or unless the parties agree to an extension of time. All of the costs of the arbitration shall be paid one-half by t he wholesaler and one-half by the brewery.

Such testing shall be conduct ed by personnel of the supervising probation agency or personnel of any program or agency approved by the supervising probation agency. E.

Street v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. App. 298, 876 S.E.2d 202, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 329 (2022). Because the search of defendants vehicle took place in 2019, that search did not and could not violate this statute or its predecessor as they had not yet bee n enacted; thus, the exclusionary provision of this statute did not entitle defendant, whose vehicle was searched prior to the enactment of that statute, to have the evidence from the search excluded. Hicks v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 401 (Va. C t. App. Aug. 30, 2022). Trial court did not err in denying defendants motion in limine to exclude evidence obtained from the traffic stop because the stop occurred before this sectio n and Va. Code Ann. § 18.2-250.1(F) took effect and this section, which prohibited searches based solely on the odor of marijuana and excluded evidence obtained from such searches, did not apply retroactively. Goodwin v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LE XIS 565 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2022). Whether procedural or substantive, this sections provision making inadmissible any evidence found pursuant to a search based solely on the odor of marijuana c ould not be applied retroactively; there was no need to determine whether this was a procedural remedy because its application to a search that was not a violation at the time of the search would not meet the requirement that proceedings conform, so far as practicable, to the laws in force at the time. Loeper v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 44 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 24, 2023). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Retroactive application.  Because this section was a substantive, statutorily created exclusionary rule that had be applied prospectively rather than retroactively, and because the complai ned of police activity occurred prior to the effective date of the statute, defendants motion to suppress evidence that was discovered after an officer smelled marijuana outside a hotel room, entered the hotel room, saw marijuana on a countertop, and after obtaining a search warrant and discovering cocaine, was denied. Commonwealth v. Cain, 108 Va. Cir. 309, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 171 (Frederick County July 26, 2021). Subsection which prohibits searches or seizures based solely on the basis of the odor of marijuana and excludes evidence obtained pursuant to a violation is a pro cedural enactment without regard for the law in place at the time of an officers conduct and applied to a traffic stop that occurred prior to the subsections enactment. Commonwealth v. Davenport, 108 Va. Cir. 456, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 210 (Chesap eake Sept. 17, 2021). Inevitable discovery.  Inevitable discovery doctrine is inapplicable to an exclusion of evidence under this section because the doctrine is inapplicable with respect to statutory rules of evidence wherein the purpose is not the deterrence of misconduct.
