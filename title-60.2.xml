Code 1950, § 60-1; 1968, c. 738, § 60.1-1; 1986, c. 480. Annotations Cross references. As to transitional severance benefits, see § 2.2-3203. Editors note. House Joint Resolution No. 195 of the 1985 Acts of Assembly directed the Virginia Code Commission to make a study of former Title 60.1 and report to the Governor and the General Assembly its findings in the form of a revision of that title. In January, 1986, its report, containing a proposed revision of former Title 60.1, was sent to the Governor and the General Assembly. The report was published as House Documen t No. 11 of the 1986 Session and served as the basis for Title 60.2, which was enacted by Acts 1986, c. 480, effective January 1, 1987. In addition to its revision by Acts 1986, c. 480, former Title 60.1 was amended by certain other acts during the 1986 Session. These amendments have been incorpor ated, as appropriate, into comparable provisions of Title 60.2, pursuant to § 30-152. Many of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 60.1 or prior law. Law Review.

Remedial character of Act.  Legislative acts of this character which provide funds for those temporarily unemployed are remedial in character. Ford Motor Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, 19 1 Va. 812, 63 S.E.2d 28, 1951 Va. LEXIS 139 (1951). The problem of the Supreme Court (now Court of Appeals) is, in the final analysis, to recognize the remedial aim and purpose of the Act and then interpret and con strue the language and apply it to the facts proved. Ford Motor Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, 191 Va. 812, 63 S.E.2d 28, 1951 Va. LEXIS 139 (1951). The Act as a whole should be so interpreted as to effectuate that remedial purpose implicit in its enactment. Ford Motor Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, 191 Va. 812, 63 S.E.2d 28, 1951 Va. LEXIS 139 (1951). The Act should be liberally construed.  The Unemployment Compensation Act should be liberally construed to effect its beneficent aims. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Collins, 182 Va. 426, 29 S.E.2d 388, 1 944 Va. LEXIS 192 (1944); R.C. Huffman Constr. Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, 184 Va. 727, 36 S.E.2d 641, 1946 Va. LEXIS 137 (1946); Ford Motor Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, 191 Va. 812, 63 S.E.2d 28, 1951 Va. LEXIS 139 (1951). The primary purpose of the Act is to provide temporary financial assistance to workmen who become unemployed through no fault of their own. Ford Motor Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, 191 Va. 812, 63 S.E.2d 28, 1951 Va. LEXIS 139 (1951); Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Tomko, 192 Va. 463, 65 S.E.2d 524, 1951 Va. LEXIS 194 (1951). The Unemployment Compensation Act is primarily a public welfare measure and the levying of taxes thereunder is merely incidental to its purpose, which is to assure a measure of security against the hazard of unemployment in our economic life. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Collins, 182 Va. 426, 29 S.E.2d 388, 1944 Va. LEXIS 192 (1944); R.C. H uffman Constr. Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, 184 Va. 727, 36 S.E.2d 641, 1946 Va. LEXIS 137 (1946); VEC v. A.I.M. Corp., 225 Va. 338, 302 S.E.2d 534, 1983 Va. LEXIS 226 (1983). And it is not merely declaratory of common-law principles.  The great weight of authority is that unemployment compensation statutes are not merely declaratory of common-law principles, but are more inclusive in their scop e. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Harvey, 179 Va. 202, 18 S.E.2d 390, 1942 Va. LEXIS 212 (1942). The trend of the courts is to recognize its beneficent purposes and to hold parties boun d by the Act. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Harvey, 179 Va. 202, 18 S.E.2d 390, 1942 Va. LEXIS 212 (1942). And to extend its coverage.  The judicial trend is to extend and not to restrict the coverage of the Unemployment Compensation Act. R.C. Huffman Constr. Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, 184 Va. 727, 36 S.E.2d 641, 1946 Va. LEXIS 137 (1946). The judicial trend is to hold that the Unemployment Compensation Act covers borderline cases. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Collins, 182 Va. 426, 29 S.E.2d 388, 19 44 Va. LEXIS 192 (1944). Employees who are discharged from employment due to misconduct connected with his work are disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. Kennedy's Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc. v. Cooper, 14 Va. App. 701, 419 S.E.2d 278, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3518, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 167 (1992). Burden of proof.  The employer bears the burden of proving misconduct. Absent circumstances in mitigation of such conduct, the employee is disqualified for benefits, and th e burden of proving mitigating circumstances rests upon the employee. Kennedy's Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc. v. Cooper, 14 Va. App. 701, 419 S.E.2d 278, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3518, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 167 (1992). Definition of misconduct has two prongs. The first prong defines misconduct as a deliber ate violation of a company rule. The definition of misconduct under the second prong contemplates actions or omissions of such a nature or so recurrent as to manifest a willful disregard of the employers interests and the duties and obligations the e mployee owes the employer. Kennedy's Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc. v. Cooper, 14 Va. App. 701, 419 S.E.2d 278, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3518, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 167 (1992). Misconduct not proven.  Employees use of vulgar language was not of such a nature as to manifest a willful disregard of employer business interests or employees duties and obliga tions to his employer. Employees remarks, while vulgar and offensive, were not a lengthy barrage. They were a part of an isolated outburst following a private two and one-half hour meeting of management officials. The chief executive officer initiate d the discussion of union organization at employers place of business, and repeatedly demanded employees resignation. Employee had been an employee of employer for almost 20 years. There was no evidence that he had a record of misconduct. There w as no evidence that employees remarks were overheard by store employees or customers. Misconduct had not been proven. Kennedy's Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc. v. Cooper, 14 Va. App. 701, 419 S.E.2d 278, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3518, 1992 Va.

CASE NOTES Common ownership of employing units.  An individual was sole proprietor of a jewelry company and owned a controlling stock interest in five corporations, each owning one or more stores and engaging in the retail jewelry business.

None of the corporations had a sufficient number of employees but all were liable under subdivision B 3 of this section, because of common ownership. They did not, however, collectively constitute a single employer for rating purposes; rather, each was a separate employer to be rated individually in accordance with its unemployment experience.

I.General Consideration. Editors note. Many of the cases below were decided under prior law. This section is to be liberally construed to effect its beneficent purpose and in border line cases employment should be found to exist. VEC v. A.I.M. Corp., 225 Va. 338, 302 S.E.2d 534, 1983 Va. LEXIS 226 (1983). Legislature may define employment subject to taxation.  In the absence of constitutional restraint the legislature may determine and define what shall constitute employment subject to taxation without regard to the com mon-law conception of that term, and such was the purpose of and result obtained by the Unemployment Compensation Act. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Harvey, 179 Va. 202, 18 S.E.2d 390, 1942 Va. LEXIS 212 (1942). And such definition is binding on the courts.  In determining the meaning of employment, as used in the Unemployment Compensation Act, the courts are bound by the statutory definition contained in this section, rather than by the common-law meaning of the master and servant relation. It was the intent of the legislature, as expressed in the language used, to make the Act broader and more inclusive than the ordinary relation of master and servant. Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, 178 Va. 46, 16 S.E.2d 357, 1941 Va. LEXIS 143 (1941); Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Harvey, 179 Va. 202, 18 S.E.2d 390, 1942 Va. LEXIS 212 (1942). This section includes individuals who would have been excluded under the common-law conc epts of master and servant, and, on the other hand, excludes a great number of persons, domestic servants, agricultural laborers and others who, under common-law concepts of master and servant, are deemed employees. Sinclair Ref. Co. v. Unemployment Comp . Comm'n, 189 Va. 692, 54 S.E.2d 72, 1949 Va. LEXIS 211 (1949). The term employment should be accorded a broader and more inclusive meaning than in the common-law context of master and servant. VEC v. A.I.M. Corp., 225 Va. 338, 302 S.E.2d 534, 1983 Va. LEXIS 226 (1983). Determination of relationship from actual practice supplementin g contract between parties.  In attempting to solve the question whether one was performing services for another and was in the latters employment under the Unemployment Compensation Act, the courts are not so much concerned with what a contract between the parties says as they are with actual practice of the parties which supplemented their written agreement. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Collins, 182 Va. 426, 29 S.E.2d 388, 1944 Va. LEX IS 192 (1944). The existence of the relation of master and servant under the Unemployment Compensation Act does not depend upon how the parties designate each other in their con tract. Sinclair Ref. Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, 189 Va. 692, 54 S.E.2d 72, 1949 Va. LEXIS 211 (1949). As at common law, and in the workers compensation context, the existence of the master-servant relationship under the act does not depend upon how the parties designate each other in their contract. Rather, the individuals status in relation to the alleged employer is to be determined from all the facts and circumstances adduced by the evidence, including the provisions of any written agreement. VEC v. A. I.M. Corp., 225 Va. 338, 302 S.E.2d 534, 1983 Va. LEXIS 226 (1983). Power of control determines relationship.  Where the party for whom the work is to be done has the power to direct the means and methods by which the other does the work, an employer-employee relationship exists; if the latter is free to adopt such means and methods as he chooses to accomplish the result, he is not an employee but an independent contractor. Among the tests used to determine if the right to control exists are: whether instructions have to be obeyed, and whether either of the parties possesses the right to terminate services at will without incurring liability to the other. VEC v. A.I.M. Corp., 225 Va. 338, 302 S.E.2d 534, 1983 Va. LEXIS 226 (1983). In any master-servant analysis, be it in the area of tort liability, workers compensation, or unemployment compensation, the power of control is the determini ng factor in ascertaining the parties status. The potential power of control, not the actual exercise of control, is the important element. And the right of control does not include only the power to specify the result to be accomplished, but, in the language of ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_60.2-213"><akn:num>§ 60.2-213</akn:num><akn:heading>Employment with hospital, higher education, state, subdivision, or certain religious or charitable organizations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Employm ent includes: 1.

CASE NOTES The Commission does not lack standing to seek review of an order as to whether an employment relation existed. It is a person aggrieved within the meaning of § 8.01-670. VEC v. A.I.M. Corp., 225 Va. 338, 302 S.E.2d 534, 1983 Va. LEXIS 226 (1983) (decided under prior law). Petitions for judicial review under this section governed by Chapter 8 of Title 8.01 and Rule 2A.  Petitions for judicial review under this section must comply with the requirements of Chapter 8 of Title 8.01 and Part 2A of the Rules of the Supreme Court; the curing statute (§ 8.01-288) applies to the service of petitions under this section because this section does not specifically prescribe a particular method of service. VEC v. Porter-Blaine Corp., 27 Va. App. 153, 497 S.E.2d 889, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (1998). Insufficiency of petition for judicial review cured by actual receipt of copies by mail.  Circuit court did not err when it denied Virginia Employment Commissions motion to dismiss petition for judicial review due to insufficient service. Although service of petition upon the Commissioner by overnight mail failed to comply with the requirements for personal service set forth in Chapter 8 of Title 8.01, the commissioner actually received the two copies of the petition by mail within the time limits prescribed by law, making service sufficient under § 8.01-288.

Employee status finding upheld.  In finding that a claimant was an employee and not an independent contractor, the Virginia Employment Commission made factual findings on each of the factors comp rising the twenty-factor test and found that the overwhelming majority of those factors weighed in favor of employee status; those factual findings were conclusive in this appeal according to the plain language of § 60.2-500(C).

B. Any nonprof it organization which, pursuant to subdivision 8 of subsection B of § 60.2-210, is or becomes subject to this title shall pay taxes under the provisions of § 60.2-511, unless it elects, in accordance with this subsection, to pay to the Commission f or the unemployment fund an amount equal to the amount of regular benefits and of one-half of the extended benefits paid, that is attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization, and that is for weeks of unemployment which begin duri ng the effective period of such election. 1. Any n onprofit organization which is or becomes subject to this title may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of taxes for a period of not less than one taxable year beginning with January 1 of each year, provided it files with the Commission a written notice of its election within the thirty-day period immediately following such date. 2. Any nonprofit organization which becomes subject to this title may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of taxes for a period of not less than twelve months beginning with the d ate on which such subjectivity begins by filing a written notice of its election with the Commission not later than thirty days immediately following the date of the determination of such subjectivity. 3. Any nonprofit organization which makes an election in accordance with subdivision 1 or 2 of this subsection shall continue to be liable for payments in lieu of taxes until it files wit h the Commission a written notice terminating its election not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of the taxable year for which such termination shall first be effective. 4. Any nonprofit organization which has been paying taxes under this title may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the Commission, not later than thirty days prior to the beginn ing of any taxable year, a written notice of election to become liable for payments in lieu of taxes. Such election shall not be terminable by the organization for that and the next year. 5. The Commission may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of election, or a notice of termination, shall be filed and may permit an election to be retroactive but not a ny earlier than January 1 of the current calendar year. 6. The Commission, in accordance with such regulations as it may prescribe, shall notify each nonprofit organization of any determination which it may make of its status as an employer an d of the effective date of any election which it makes and of any termination of such election.

If the final adjudication of a disputed claim finds the claimant totally or partially ineligible for benefits, the nonprofit organization shall be liable for any bill resulting fr om payments made to the claimant during or prior to the appeal process, whether made by erroneous statutory interpretation, administrative error, or incorrect wage reporting. 2. a. Eac h nonprofit organization that has elected payments in lieu of taxes may request permission to make such payments as provided in this paragraph. Such method of payment shall become effective upon approval by the Commission. b. At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of such other period as determined by the Commission, the Commission shall bill each nonprofit organization for an amount repres enting one of the following: (1) One-tenth of one percent of its total payroll for the preceding calendar year. (2) Such percentage of its total payroll for the immediately preceding calendar year as the Commission shall determine. Such determination shall be based each year on the average benefit costs attributable to service in the employ of nonprofit organizations during the preceding calendar year. (3) For any organization which did not pay wages throughout the four calendar quarters of the preceding calendar year, such percentage of its payroll during such year as the Commission shall determine. c. At the end of each taxable year, the Commission may modify the quarterly percentage of payroll thereafter payable by the nonprofit organization in order to minimize excess or insu fficient payments. d. At the end of each taxable year, the Commission shall determine whether the total of payments for such year made by a nonprofit organization is more or less than the total amount of regular benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid to individuals during such taxable year based on wages attributable to service in the employ of such organization. Each nonprofit organization whose total payments for such year ar e less than the amount so determined shall be liable for payment of the unpaid balance to the fund in accordance with subdivision 3 of this subsection. If the total payments exceed the amount so determined for the taxable year, all or a part of the exces s may, at the discretion of the Commission, be refunded from the fund or retained in the fund as part of the payments which may be required for the next taxable year. 3. Payment of any bill rendered under subdivision 1 or 2 of this subsection shall be made not later than thirty days after such bill was mailed to the last known address of the nonprofit organization or was otherwise delivered to it, unless there has been an application for review and redetermination in accordance with subdivision 5 of this subsection. 4. Payments made by any nonprofit organization under the provisions of this subsection shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in th e employ of the organization. 5.

In the disc retion of the Commission, any nonprofit organization that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of taxes shall be required within thirty days after the effective date of its election (i) to execute and file with the Commission a surety bond approv ed by the Commission or (ii) to deposit with the Commission money or securities. The amount of such bond or deposit shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this section. B. The amount of the bond or deposit required by this section shall be a percentage, determined by the Commission, of the organizations taxable wages paid for employment as defined in subdivision 4 of subsection A of § 60.2-213 for the four calendar quarters im mediately preceding the effective date of the election, the renewal date in the case of a bond, or the biennial anniversary of the effective date of election in the case of a deposit of money or securities, whichever date is most recent and applicable. I f the nonprofit organization did not pay wages in each of such four calendar quarters, the amount of the bond or deposit shall be as determined by the Commission. C. Any bond de posited under this section shall be in force for a period of not less than two taxable years and shall be renewed with the approval of the Commission, at such time as the Commission may prescribe, but not less frequently than at two-year intervals as lon g as the organization continues to be liable for payments in lieu of taxes. The Commission shall require adjustments to be made in a previously filed bond as it deems appropriate. If the bond is to be increased, the adjusted bond shall be filed by the or ganization within thirty days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed or otherwise delivered to it. Failure by any organization covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments in lieu of taxes when due, together with any applicab le interest and penalties provided for in subdivision 6 of subsection C of § 60.2-501, shall render the surety liable on such bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was such organization. D. Any deposit of money or securities made in accordance with this section shall be retained by the Commission in an escrow account until liability under the election is terminated, at which time it shall be returned to the organization, less any deductions as hereina fter provided. The Commission may deduct from the money deposited under this section by a nonprofit organization or sell the securities it has so deposited to the extent necessary to satisfy any due and unpaid payments in lieu of taxes and any applicable interest and penalties provided for in subdivision 6 of subsection C of § 60.2-501. The Commission shall require the organization within thirty days following any deduction from a money deposit or sale of deposited securities under the provisions of this subsection to deposit sufficient additional money or securities to make whole the organizations deposit at the prior level. Any cash remaining from the sale of such securities shall be a part of the organizations escrow account. The Commissi on may review the adequacy of the deposit made by any organization. If, as a result of such review, it determines that an adjustment is necessary, the organization shall be required to make additional deposit within thirty days of written notice of the d etermination or the Commission shall return to it such portion of the deposit as it no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate. Disposition of income from securities held in escrow shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the state law. E. If any nonp rofit organization fails to file a bond or make a deposit, or to file a bond in an increased amount or to increase or make whole the amount of a previously made deposit, as provided under this subsection, the Commission may terminate such organization s election to make payments in lieu of taxes and such termination shall continue for not less than the four consecutive calendar quarter period beginning with the quarter in which such termination becomes effective; however, the Commission may extend for good cause the applicable filing, deposit or adjustment period by not more than thirty days.

The Commiss ion is hereby expressly authorized to require the filing of payroll and tax reports, and the payment of the taxes required by § 60.2-511 in monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual payments as shall be determined by the Commission; however, if the due date for filing of reports or payment of taxes falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the due date shall be extended to the next business day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. Beginning January 1, 2013, employers may file payroll a nd tax reports, and pay the taxes required by § 60.2-511, annually, in the time, form and manner prescribed by the Commission, if the employment that is the subject of the report of taxes due under this chapter consists exclusively of domestic service in a private home of the employer, as defined in §§ 31.3121 (a)(7)-1, 31.3306 (c)(2)-1, and 31.3401 (a)(3)-1 of the Employment Tax Regulations promulgated pursuant to §§ 3121, 3306, and 3401 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. The aggr egate amount of taxes shall be fully paid to the Commission on or before January 31 of each year next succeeding the year with respect to employment during which year such taxes are imposed, or in the event the time is extended for filing the return of t he taxes imposed by Title IX of the Social Security Act for the year for which such taxes are imposed, then before the expiration of such extension. Taxes due and payable in an amount less than five dollars shall be deemed to be fully paid; however, this does not relieve an employer from filing payroll and tax reports as herein required. B. Beginning J anuary 1, 2021, all employers shall file quarterly reports on an electronic medium using a format prescribed by the Commission. Waivers will be granted only if the Commission finds this requirement creates an unreasonable burden on the employer. All requ ests for waiver must be submitted in writing. Beginning January 1, 2021, if any employer who has not obtained a waiver by the date the employers quarterly report is due, fails, without good cause shown, to file electronically, the Commission shall as sess upon the employer a penalty of $75, which penalty shall be in addition to the taxes due and payable with respect to such report and to any penalty assessed under subsection B of § 60.2-513. Penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be pa id into the Special Unemployment Compensation Administration Fund established pursuant to § 60.2-314. C. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection A, no payroll and tax reports shall be filed with respect to an employee of a state or local agency performing intelligence or counterintelligence functions, if the head of such agency has determined that filing such a r eport could endanger the safety of the employee or compromise an ongoing investigation or intelligence mission.

For survey of Virginia law on governmental services and social welfare for the year 1976-1977, see 63 Va. L. Rev. 1440 (1977). CASE NOTES Section does not violate due process.  The contention that this section arbitrarily and unlawfully deprives unemployment compensation claimants receiving pensions of a protected property interest, viz. , unemployment benefits, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is meritless. Watkins v. Cantrell, 736 F.2d 933, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 21793 (4th Cir. 1984) (decided under prior law). Sect ion not unconstitutionally arbitrary or irrational.  Because ease of administration and preservation of the financial integrity of a states unemployment insurance compensation program are legitimate state intere sts that can justify the classifications created by the Virginia pension offset provision, the Virginia pension offset provision is not so patently arbitrary or irrational as to be constitutionally infirm. Watkins v. Cantrell, 736 F.2d 933, 1984 U.S. App . LEXIS 21793 (4th Cir. 1984) (decided under prior law). Section does not contravene federal pension offset requirement, 26 U.S.C. § 3304(a)(15). Watkins v. Cantrell, 736 F.2d 933, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 21793 (4th Cir. 1984) (decided under prior law). The language is receiving in this section is not limited to the contemporaneous payment of benefits. It also includes a later lump sum payment that is reasonably attributable to the period in which unemployment benefits were received. Thus, benefits in the instant case were subject to a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of t he subsequent lump sum social security benefit payout for that period. VEC v. Nunery, 24 Va.

E. 1. Whenever an extended benefit period is to become effective in this Commonwealth as a result of a state on indicator, or an extended benefit period is to be terminated in this Commonwealth as a result of state off indicators, the Commission shall make an appropriate public announcement. 2. Computations required by the provisions of subsection B of § 60.2-610 shall be made by the Commission, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the United States Secretary of La bor. 3. An on or off indicator for this Commonwealth shall be determined without regard to subdivision 1 of subsection H of § 60.2-610 for any period that waiver of such pro visions is authorized under § 203 (d) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act (26 U.S.C. § 3304) and any amendments thereto, or as authorized by any provision of federal law. F. 1.

Such gross average weekly remuneration shall pay wages equal to the higher of: (1) The minimum wages provided by § 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.), without regard to any exemption; or (2) The state or local minimum wage. c. No individual, however, shall be denied extended benefits for failure to accept an offer or referral to any job which meets the definition of suitable work as described in subdivi sion 3a of this subsection if: (1) The position was not offered to such individual in writing or was not listed with the Job Service; (2) Such failure could not result in a denial of benefits under the definition of suitable work for regular benefit claimants in subdivision 3 of § 60.2-618 to the ext ent that the criteria of suitability in that section are not inconsistent with the provisions of this subdivision; or (3) The individual furnishes satisfactory evidence to the Commission that his prospects for obtaining work in his customary occupation within a reasonably short period ar e good. If the evidence is deemed satisfactory for this purpose, the determination of whether any work is suitable with respect to such individual shall be made in accordance with the definition of suitable work in subdivision 3 of § 60.2-618 without regard to the definition specified by this subdivision. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, no work shall be deemed to be suitable work for an individual which does not accord with the labor standard provisions required by § 3304(a)5 of the Internal Revenue Code and set forth under subdivision 3 of § 60.2-618. 5. For the purposes of subdivision 1 b of this subsection, an individual shall be treated as actively engaged in seeking work during any week if: a. The individual has engaged in a systematic and sustained effort to obtain work during such week; and b. The individual furnishes tangible evidence that he has engaged in such effort during such week. 6. The Job Service shall refer any claimant entitled to extended benefits under this title to any suitable work which meets the criteria prescribed in subdivision 3 of this subsection. 7. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, if the benefit year of any individual ends within an extended benefit period, the remaining balance of extended benefits that such individual would, but for this section, be entitled to receive in that extended benefit period, for weeks of unemployment beginning after the end of the benefit year, shall be reduced, but not below zero, by the product of the number of weeks for which the individual received any amounts as trade readjustment allowances within that benefit year, multiplied by the individuals weekly benefit amount for extended benefits. 8. No claim for extended benefits shall be subject to subdivisions 1, 2, 3 or 6 of this subsection for weeks of unemployment beginning after March 6, 1993, and before January 1, 1995. If the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 is at any time amended to preclude enforcement of any provision of this section, such provision shall not apply to any claim for weeks beginning on the date said amendment becomes effective . G. 1. Except as provided in subdivision 2 of this subsection, an individual shall not be e ligible for extended benefits for any week if: a. Extended benefits are payable for such week pursuant to an interstate claim filed in any state under the interstate benefit plan; and b. No extended benefit period is in effect for such week in such state. 2. Subdivision 1 of this subsection shall not apply to the first two weeks for which extended benefits are payable, determined without regard to this subsection, pursuant to an interstate claim filed under the interstate benefit payment plan to the individual from the extended benefit account established for the individual with respect to the benefit year. H. Effective w ith respect to weeks beginning in a high unemployment period that commenced on or after February 1, 2009, and thereafter until the week ending three weeks prior to the last week for which federal sharing is authorized by Section 2005(a) of Public Law 111 -5, or by an extension thereof or amendment thereto, subsection D shall be applied by substituting (i) eighty percent for fifty percent in subdivision D 1; (ii) twenty for thirteen in subdivision D 2; and (iii) forty-s ix for thirty-nine in subdivision D 3. As used in this subsection, high unemployment period means any period during which an extended benefit period would be in effect if subdivision H 2 b of § 60.2-610 were applied by substituting eight percent for six and one-half percent. History History. 1982, c. 237, § 60.1-51.2; 1986, c. 480; 1993, c. 153; 2008, S p.

An unemploy ed individual shall be eligible to receive benefits for any week only if the Commission finds that: 1. He ha s, in the highest two quarters of earnings within his base period, been paid wages in employment for employers that are equal to not less than the lowest amount appearing in Column A of the Benefit Table appearing in § 60.2-602 on the line whi ch extends through Division C and on which in Column B of the Benefit Table appears his weekly benefit amount. Such wages shall be earned in not less than two quarters. 2. a. His total or partial unemployment is not due to a labor dispute in active progress or to shutdown or start-up operations caused by such dispute which exists (i) at the factory, establishment, or other premises, including a vessel, at which he is or was last employed, or (ii) at a factory, establishment or other premises, including a vessel, either within or without this Commonwealth, which (a) is owned or operated by the same employing unit which owns or operates the premises at which he is or was last emp loyed and (b) supplies materials or services necessary to the continued and usual operation of the premises at which he is or was last employed. This subdivision shall not apply if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commission that: (1) He is not participating in or financing or directly interested in the labor dispute; and (2) He does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the labor dispute, there were members employed at the premises, inc luding a vessel, at which the labor dispute occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute. b. If separate branches of work which are commonly conducted as separate businesses at separate premises are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each such departm ent shall, for the purposes of this subdivision, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment or other premises. Membership in a union, or the payment of regular dues to a bona fide labor organization, however, shall not alone constitute financing a labor dispute. 3. He is not receiving, has not received or is not seeking unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of any other state or of the United States; however, if the appropr iate agency of such other state or of the United States finally determines that he is not entitled to such unemployment benefits, this subdivision shall not apply. 4. He is not on a bona fide paid vacation. If an individual is paid vacation pay for any week in an amount less than the individuals weekly benefit amount his eligibility for benefits shall be computed under the provisions of § 60.2-603. 5. He has registered for work and thereafter has continued to report at an employment office in accordance with such regulations as the Commission may prescribe. The Commission may, by re gulation, waive or alter either or both of the requirements of this subdivision for certain types of cases when it finds that compliance with such requirements would be oppressive, or would be inconsistent with the purposes of this title. 6. He has made a claim for benefits in accordance with regulations the Commission may prescribe. 7. a. He is able to work, is available for work, and is actively seeking and unable to obtain suitable work. Every claimant who is totally unemployed shall report to the Commission the names of employers contacted each week in his effort to obtain work. This info rmation may be subject to employer verification by the Commission through a program designed for that purpose. The Commission may determine that registration by a claimant with the Virginia State Job Service may constitute a valid employer contact and sa tisfy the search for work requirement of this subsection in labor market areas where job opportunities are limited. The Commission may determine that an individual, whose usual and customary means of soliciting work in his occupation is through contact w ith a single hiring hall which makes contacts with multiple employers on behalf of the claimant, meets the requirement that he be actively seeking and unable to obtain suitable work by contacting that hiring hall alone. In areas of high unemployment, as determined by the Commission, the Commission has the authority to adjust the requirement that he be actively seeking and unable to obtain suitable work. b. An individual who leaves the normal labor market area of the individual for the major portion of any week is presumed to be unavailable for work within the meaning of this section . This presumption may be overcome if the individual establishes to the satisfaction of the Commission that the individual has conducted a bona fide search for work and has been reasonably accessible to suitable work in the labor market area in which the individual spent the major portion of the week to which the presumption applies. c. An individual whose type of work is such that it is performed by individuals working two or more shifts in a 24-hour period shall not be deemed unavailable for work if the individ ual is currently enrolled in one or more classes of education related to employment or is continuing in a certificate or degree program at an institution of higher education, provided that the enrollment would only limit the individuals availability for one shift and the individual is otherwise available to work any of the other shifts. 8. He has given notice of resignation to his employer and the employer subsequently made the termination of employment effective prior to the date of termination as given in the notice, b ut in no case shall unemployment compensation benefits awarded under this subdivision exceed two weeks; provided, that the claimant could not establish good cause for leaving work pursuant to § 60.2-618 and was not discharged for misconduct as provide d in § 60.2-618. 9. Beginning January 6, 1991, he has served a waiting period of one week during which he was eligible for benefits under this section in all other respects and has not received benefits, except that only one waiting week shall be required of such individual within any benefit year. For claims filed effective November 28, 1999, and after, this requirement shall be waived for any individual whose unemployment was caused by his employer ter minating operations, closing its business or declaring bankruptcy without paying the final wages earned as required by § 40.1-29 of the Code of Virginia. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, if an employer who terminates operations, clos es its business or declares bankruptcy pays an individual his final wages after the period of time prescribed by § 40.1-29 of the Code of Virginia, such payment shall not be offset against the benefits the individual was otherwise entitled to receive and shall not, under any circumstances, cause such individual to be declared overpaid benefits. 10. He is not imprisoned or confined in jail. 11. He participates in reemployment services, such as job search assistance services, if he has been determined to be likely to exhaust regular benefits and need reemployment services p ursuant to a profiling system established by the Commission, unless the Commission determines that (i) such claimant has completed such services or (ii) there is good cause for such claimants failure to participate in such services. B. Prior to an y individual receiving benefits under this chapter, the Commission shall conduct an incarceration check and an employment identification check to verify the status of the unemployed individual seeking a claim for benefits.

Ability and Availability for Work. I.General Consideration. Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. Eligibility under this section differs from that under § 60.2-618.  Where claimants contended, under this section, that their unemployment was not caused by a directive of their labor union restricting work to three days per week, but by economic conditions, such argument was held to be entirely beside the point, because the issue was eligibility to compensation under this section, which is a different matter from disqualification because of a labor dispute under § 60.2-618.

No otherwis e eligible individual shall be denied benefits for any week because he is in training with the approval of the Commission, including training under § 134 of the Workforce Investment Act, nor shall such individual be denied benefits for any week in whi ch he is in training with the approval of the Commission, including training under § 134 of the Workforce Investment Act, by reason of the application of the provisions in subdivision A 7 of § 60.2-612 relating to availability for work, or the prov isions of subdivision 3 of § 60.2-618 relating to failure to apply for, or a refusal to accept, suitable work. B. Notwithstan ding any other provisions of this chapter, no otherwise eligible individual shall be denied benefits for any week because he is in training approved under § 2296 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq.), nor shall such individual be denied benef its by reason of leaving work to enter such training, provided the work left is not suitable employment, or because of the application to any such week in training of provisions in this law (or any applicable federal unemployment compensation law), relat ing to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work. C. For purpose s of this section, suitable employment means, with respect to an individual, work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the individuals past adversely affected employment, as defined for purposes of the Trade Act, and wages for such work at not less than eighty percent of the individuals average weekly wage as determined for the purposes of the Trade Act.

CASE NOTES The intent of subsection B is clearly to enable qualified persons to resign employment t o participate in a training program under the federal Trade Act, without incurring a loss of unemployment benefits. Consistent with this purpose, the statute expressly preserves such benefits upon voluntary termination to enter such program. VEC v. Fitzgerald, 19 Va. App. 491, 452 S.E.2d 692, 1995 Va.

That the legislature intended the term during thirty days to define a number of days, not a period of time, is verified by the legis lative inclusion of the clause whether or not such days were consecutive. Virginia Empl.

The disqualifica tion shall commence with the week in which such failure occurred, and shall continue for the period of unemployment next ensuing until he has performed services for an employer (i) during 30 days, whether or not such days are consecutive, or (ii) for 240 hours, and subsequently becomes totally or partially separated from such employment. b. In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, the Commission shall consider the degree of risk involved to his health, safety and morals, his physical fitn ess and prior training, his experience, his length of unemployment and the accessibility of the available work from his residence. c. No work shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be denied under this title to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions: (1) If the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute; (2) If the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality ; or (3) If as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organizatio n. d. No individual shall be qualified for benefits during any week that such individual, in connection with an offer of suitable work, has a confirmed positive test for a nonprescribed controlled substance, identified as such in Chapter 34 (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.) of Title 54.1, if the test is required as a condition of employment and (i) performed, and a sample is collected, in accordance with scientifically recognized standards by a laboratory accredited by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or the College of American Pathology, or the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, or the equivalent, or (ii) a United States Department of Transportation-qualifi ed drug screen conducted in accordance with the employers bona fide drug policy. The disqualification shall commence with the week in which such a test was conducted, and shall continue for the period of unemployment next ensuing until he has perform ed services for an employer (i) during 30 days, whether or not such days are consecutive, or (ii) for 240 hours, and subsequently becomes totally or partially separated from such employment. 4. For 52 weeks, beginning with the date of the determination or decision, if the Commission finds that such individual, within 36 calendar months immediately preceding such determination or decision, has made a false statement or representation knowing it to be false, or has knowingly failed to disclose a material fact, to obtain or increase any benefit or payment under this title, the unemployment compensation of any other state, or an y other program of the federal government which is administered in any way under this title, either for himself or any other person. Overpayments that have been fraudulently obtained and any penalty assessed against the individual pursuant to § 60.2-6 36 shall be recoverable as provided in § 60.2-633. 5. If such separation arose as a result of an unlawful act which resulted in a conviction and after his release from prison or jail until he has performed services for an employer for (i) 30 days, whether or not such days are consecutive, or (ii) 240 hours, and subsequently becomes totally or partially separated from such employment. 6. If such separation arose as a condition of the individuals parole or release from a custodial or penal institution and such individual was participating in the community correction s alternative program pursuant to § 19.2-316.4.

A representative designated by the Commission as a deputy, shall promptly examine th e claim. On the basis of the facts found by him, the deputy shall either: a. Determine whether or not such claim is valid, and if valid, the week with respect to which benefits shall commence, the weekly benefit amount payable and the maximum duration thereof; or b. Refer such claim or any question involved therein to any appeal tribunal or to the Commission, which tribunal or Commission shall make its determination in accordance with the pro cedure described in § 60.2-620. 2. When the payment or denial of benefits will be determined by the provisions of subdivision A 2 of § 60.2-612, the deputy shall promptly transmit his full finding of fact with respec t to that subdivision to any appeal tribunal, which shall make its determination in accordance with the procedure described in § 60.2-620. B. Upon the fi ling of an initial claim for benefits, the Commission shall cause an informatory notice of such filing to be mailed to the most recent 30-day or 240-hour employing unit of the claimant and all subsequent employing units, and any reimbursable employing un its which may be liable for reimbursement to the Commission for any benefits paid. However, the failure to furnish such notice shall not have any effect upon the claim for benefits. If a claimant has had a determination of initial eligibility for benefit s under this chapter, as evidenced by the issuance of compensation or waiting-week credit, payments shall continue, subject to a presumption of continued eligibility and in accordance with the terms of this subsection, until a determination is made that provides the claimant notice and an opportunity to be heard. When a question concerning continued eligibility for benefits arises, a determination shall be made as to whether it affects future weeks of benefits or only past weeks. With respect to future weeks, presumptive payment shall not be made until but no later than the end of the week following the week in which such issue arises, regardless of the type of issue. With respect to past weeks, presumptive payment shall be issued immediately, regardle ss of the type of issue. Notice shall be given to individuals who receive payments under such presumption that pending eligibility may affect their entitlement to the payment and may result in an overpayment that requires repayment. C. Notice of d etermination upon a claim shall be promptly given to the claimant by delivering or by mailing such notice to the claimants last known address. In addition, notice of any determination which involves the application of the provisions of § 60.2-618, together with the reasons therefor, shall be promptly given in the same manner to the most recent 30-day or 240-hour employing unit by whom the claimant was last employed and any subsequent employing unit which is a party. The Commission may dispense wi th the giving of notice of any determination to any employing unit, and such employing unit shall not be entitled to such notice if it has failed to respond timely or adequately to a written request of the Commission for information, as required by § 60.2-528.1, from which the deputy may have determined that the claimant may be ineligible or disqualified under any provision of this title. The deputy shall promptly notify the claimant of any decision made by him at any time which in any manner denies benefits to the claimant for one or more weeks. D. Such determ ination or decision shall be final unless the claimant or any such employing unit files an appeal from such determination or decision (i) within 30 calendar days after the delivery of such notification, (ii) within 30 calendar days after such notificatio n was mailed to his last known address, or (iii) within 30 days after such notification was mailed to the last known address of an interstate claimant. For good cause shown, the 30-day period may be extended. A claim that the Commission has determined to be invalid because of monetary ineligibility shall first be subject to review only upon a request for redetermination pursuant to § 60.2-629. The Commission shall issue a new monetary determination as a result of such review, and such monetary determ ination shall become final unless appealed by the claimant within 30 days of the date of mailing. The Commission shall clearly set out the process for requesting a redetermination and the process for filing an appeal on each monetary determination issued . Monetary ineligibility does not include an appeal on the effective date of the claim, unless the claimant has requested and received a redetermination of the monetary determination pursuant to § 60.2-629. E. Benefits sh all be paid promptly in accordance with a determination or redetermination under this chapter, or decision of an appeal tribunal, the Commission, the Board of Review or a reviewing court under §§ 60.2-625 and 60.2-631 upon the issuance of such dete rmination, redetermination or decision, regardless of the pendency of the period to file an appeal or petition for judicial review that is provided in this chapter, or the pendency of any such appeal or review. Such benefits shall be paid unless or until such determination, redetermination or decision has been modified or reversed by a subsequent redetermination or decision, in which event benefits shall be paid or denied for weeks of unemployment thereafter in accordance with such modifying or reversin g redetermination or decision. If a decision of an appeal tribunal allowing benefits is affirmed in any amount by the Commission, benefits shall continue to be paid until such time as a court decision has become final so that no further appeal can be tak en. If an appeal is taken from the Commissions decision, benefits paid shall result in a benefit charge to the account of the employer under § 60.2-530 only when, and as of the date on which, as the result of an appeal, the courts finally determin e that the Commission should have awarded benefits to the claimant or claimants involved in such appeal.

Moore v. PYA Monarch, LLC, 238 F. Supp. 2d 724, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25171 (E.D. Va. 2002). Individual was prohibited from using reports submitted to the Virginia Employment Commission to support his claim for defamation because such reports were privile ged. Shabazz v. PYA Monarch, LLC, 271 F. Supp. 2d 797, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12501 (E.D. Va. 2003). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Hearsay evidence admissible.  Denial of unemployment benefits to the employee under subdivision 2 of § 60.2-618 was appropriate because the Virginia Employment Commission appropriately acce pted the supervisors statement under subsection A of § 60.2-623 even though it was hearsay. The decision of how much weight should be accorded hearsay evidence was purely discretionary; there was no allegation of fraud in the case; and the weight and credibility given to the testimony was appropriately reserved to the commission. Levister v. Va. Empl. Comm'n, 78 Va. Cir. 361, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 176 (Richmond June 5, 2009). Hearsay evidence was admissible in an unemployment compensation hearing where the employers statement concerning discharge included information about the clai mants use of profane language that was racially and sexually demeaning. The supporting evidence in the record was not solely hearsay in nature and there was sufficient nonhearsay evidence available in the record to verify information from the hearsay evidence. Nelson v. Va. Empl. Comm'n, 78 Va. Cir. 381, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Norfolk June 16, 2009). § 60.2-623.1. Partys recording of hearing. Text A. Any party t o a compensation hearing of the Virginia Employment Commission may employ the use of a court reporter to record for transcription the proceeding, provided it is done at the partys own expense. B. In the even t the Commissions transcript of the proceeding is lost, damaged, or parts are missing, a transcript existing as a result of subsection A of this section may be used in addition to any full or partial Commission transcript.

In such action against the Commission, the Commission and any other party to the administrative procedures before the Commission shall be named a defendant in a petition for judicial review. Such petition shall also state the gr ounds upon which a review is sought; it shall be served upon a member of the Commission or upon such person as the Commission may designate, and such service shall be deemed completed service on all parties. There shall be left with the party so served a s many copies of the petition as there are defendants, and the Commission shall forthwith mail one such copy to each such defendant.

In general.  In undertaking judicial review of a commission decision pursuant to subsection A, the courts must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding by the Commission. VEC v. Fitzgerald, 19 Va. App. 491, 452 S.E.2d 692, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1995). Venue is where claimant was last employed.  The proper venue for judicial review under this section is in the court of record where claimant was last employed in this State. VEC v. Coleman, 204 Va. 18, 129 S.E.2d 6, 1963 Va. LEXIS 110 (1963) (decided prior to 1987 amendment). In this State.  The phrase was last employed, formerly contained in this section, means was last employed in this State. VEC v. Coleman, 204 Va. 18, 129 S.E.2d 6, 1963 Va. LEXIS 110 (1963) (decided prior to 1987 amendment). Objection based on last place of employment cannot be raised after decision.  An objection to the jurisdiction of the reviewing court on grounds that claimant was not last employed in that county or city is a venue objection and therefore c annot be raised for the first time after the court has decided the case. VEC v. Coleman, 204 Va. 18, 129 S.E.2d 6, 1963 Va. LEXIS 110 (1963) (decided prior to 1987 amendment). Lack of evidence in record to support Commissions findings.  This section does not preclude review when no evidence in the record supports the Commissions findings of fact. Flowers v. VEC, No. 0778-90-3 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 22, 1991). Finding that the employee was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits under subdivision 2 of § 60.2-618 because she was discharged from her employmen t due to misconduct was inappropriate because it relied on conduct without finding that she deliberately violated a company rule reasonably designed to protect legitimate business interests of her employer or engaged in acts or omissions of such a nature or so recurrent as to manifest a willful disregard of those interests and the duties and obligations she owed employer. Hall v. Va. Empl. Comm'n &amp; Process Mgmt. Techs., Inc., 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 187 (Va. Ct. App. June 18, 2013). This section merely sets forth proper venue for petitions for judicial review of a decis ion of the State Employment Commission, and dismissal was an inappropriate remedy for failure to file in the proper forum. Downs v. VEC, 4 Va. App. 454, 358 S.E.2d 737, 4 Va. Law Rep. 139, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 198 (1987). The General Assembly has enacted procedural requirements which are clear and unambiguous; because this section is unequivocal, it must be followed exactly. Miller v. VEC, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 333 (Va. Ct. App. May 7, 1991). Compliance with requirement that other parties be joined as defendants is mandatory.  Compliance with the requirements of this section that other parties to the administrative proceedings be joined as defendants is mandatory to confer jurisdiction. Miller v. VEC, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 333 (Va. Ct. App. May 7, 1991). Filing period was jurisdictional.  The circuit court was correct when it concluded that the filing period was jurisdictional, and thus, it did not have the authority or ability to extend the period . G.S. Foods, Inc. v. VEC, 12 Va. App. 541, 404 S.E.2d 741, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2658, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 109 (1991). No right to amend petition after expiration of appeal period.  This section does not provide for amending a petition after the appeal period has expired and does not expressly incorporate Rule 1:8, which is a rule of general civil procedure; since granting permission to amend a pleading outside the statutory appeal period is not an implicit right of an appellate tribunal, a trial court did not commit error in refusing to permit such an amendment. Garland v. Virginia Empl. Co mm'n, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 585 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 8, 2000). Jurisdictional amount.  Under this section the Supreme Court (now Court of Appeals) has jurisdiction to review decisions of the Commission pertaining to benefit claims regardless of the amount involved. VEC v. Coleman, 204 Va. 18, 129 S.E.2d 6, 1963 Va. LEXIS 110 (1963). Issues of suitability of work and good cause are mixed questions of law and fact reviewa ble by the appellate court on appeal. Johnson v. VEC, 8 Va. App. 441, 382 S.E.2d 476, 6 Va. Law Rep. 82, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 94 (1989). Intrinsic fraud.  If the Commissions decision was procured by intrinsic fraud, its decision is voidable until it becomes final. Jones v. Willard, 224 Va. 602, 299 S.E.2d 504, 1 983 Va. LEXIS 167 (1983). Extrinsic fraud.  If the Commissions decision was procured by extrinsic fraud, then its decision is void, the claim must be considered ab initio, and a new decision must be ren dered. Jones v. Willard, 224 Va. 602, 299 S.E.2d 504, 1983 Va. LEXIS 167 (1983). Extrinsic fraud is conduct which prevents a fair submission of the controversy to the court. Wells Fargo Alarm Servs., Inc. v. VEC, 24 Va. App. 377, 482 S.E.2d 84 1, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 169 (1997). Scope of review of questions of fraud.  Under this section, circuit courts have original jurisdiction over questions of fraud allegedly committed by a member or agent of the Commission, but with respect to questions of fraud allegedly committed by an employer or an employee, their jurisdiction is limited to appellate review of the record of the administrative proceedings. Jones v. Willard, 224 Va. 602, 299 S.E.2d 504, 1983 Va. LEXIS 167 (1983). Commission responsibility as f actfinder.  As the factfinder, the commission is charged with the responsibility of resolving questions of credibility and of controverted facts, and the commission must also determine whether the employees evidence sufficiently mitigates the violation or behavior so as to avoid disqualification because of misconduct. VEC v. Gantt, 7 Va. App. 631, 376 S.E.2d 808, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1704, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 10 (1989). Commissions findings of fa ct conclusive.  A suit to recover payroll taxes brought under § 60.2-521 is not a court review of a decision of the Commission, in which the latters findings of fa ct are conclusive, as provided in this section. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Harvey, 179 Va. 202, 18 S.E.2d 390, 1942 Va. LEXIS 212 (1942). The Commissions findings of fact, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, are made conclusive, and the jurisdiction of the circuit courts is con fined to questions of law. VEC v. City of Virginia Beach, 222 Va. 728, 284 S.E.2d 595, 1981 Va. LEXIS 367 (1981).

However, if an overpayment of benefits under this chap ter, but not under an unemployment benefit program of the United States or of any other state, occurred due to administrative error, the Commission shall have the authority to negotiate the terms of repayment, which shall include (i) deducting up to 50 p ercent of the payable amount for any future week of benefits claimed, rounded down to the next lowest dollar until the overpayment is satisfied; (ii) forgoing collection of the payable amount until the recipient has found employment as defined in § 60 .2-212; or (iii) determining and instituting an individualized repayment plan. The Commission shall collect an overpayment of benefits under this chapter caused by administrative error only by offset against future benefits or a negotiated repayment plan ; however, the Commission may institute any other method of collection if the individual fails to enter into or comply with the terms of the repayment plan. Administrative error shall not include decisions reversed in the appeals process. In addition, th e overpayment may be collectible by civil action in the name of the Commission. Amounts collected in this manner may be subject to an interest charge as prescribed in § 58.1-15 from the date of judgment and may be subject to fees and costs. Collection activities for any benefit overpayment established of five dollars or less may be suspended. The Commission may, for good cause, determine as uncollectible and discharge from its records any benefit overpayment which remains unpaid after the expiration of seven years from the date such overpayment was determined, or immediately upon the death of such person or upon his discharge in bankruptcy occurring subsequently to the determination of overpayment. Any existing overpayment balance not equal to an ev en dollar amount shall be rounded to the next lowest even dollar amount. B. The Commiss ion is authorized to accept repayment of benefit overpayments by use of a credit card. The Virginia Employment Commission shall add to such payment a service charge for the acceptance of such card. Such service charge shall not exceed the percentage char ged to the Virginia Employment Commission for use of such card. C. Final order s of the Commission with respect to benefit overpayments may be recorded, enforced and satisfied as orders or decrees of a circuit court upon certification of such orders by the Commissioner as may be appropriate.

CASE NOTES Section does not violate due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Brewer v. Cantr ell, 622 F. Supp. 1320, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14218 (W.D. Va. 1985), aff'd, 796 F.2d 472, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 18486 (4th Cir. 1986) (decided under prior law). Different treatment under this section and § 60.2-619 constitutional.  Persons who fall under § 60.2-619 are in a different situation than those under this section. Because they are in different situations, the Commission may trea t them differently. This does not constitute a violation of the equal protection clause. The Commission treats all people who are under § 60.2-619 alike. The Commission also treats all people who are under this section alike. Brewer v. Cantrell, 622 F . Supp. 1320, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14218 (W.D. Va. 1985), aff'd, 796 F.2d 472, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 18486 (4th Cir. 1986) (decided under prior law). Eleventh Amendment does not bar claim based on Commissions attempt to recover overpayments.  The Eleventh Amendment, which bars suits which would cause funds to be paid out of the general treasury of a state, did not bar a claim that action taken by the V EC in attempting to recover overpayments violated the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 501 et seq., the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. § 3301 et seq., the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the equal protection clause of t he Fourteenth Amendment, since Virginias unemployment compensation fund is a special fund. Brewer v. Cantrell, 622 F. Supp. 1320, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14218 (W.D. Va. 1985), aff'd, 796 F.2d 472, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 18486 (4th Cir. 1986) (decided un der prior law). Section does not violate when due provision of 42 U.S.C. § 503(a)(1). It is a statute that is needed under the requirements of the Social Security Act and is not in violation of the Act. Brewer v. Cantrell, 622 F. Supp. 1320, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14218 (W.D. Va. 1985), aff'd, 796 F.2d 472, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 18486 (4th Cir. 19 86) (decided under prior law). Promptness requirement.  Promptness requirement of the statute is mandatory for the Virginia Employment Commission; therefore, in a case involving unemployment compensation, the promp tness requirement language prevented the Virginia Employment Commission from deciding that a claimant had to repay unemployment compensation more than two years after receiving it. An untimely determination that she was ineligible and required to rep ay the unemployment compensation was incorrect and unenforceable. Va. Empl. Comm'n v. Cole, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 104 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 5, 2016). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Employee is liable for overpayment.  Decision of the Virginia Employment Commission, which ultimately found that the former employee was not entitled to benefits, and that the employee was required t o pay back benefits already paid, was affirmed because the employees job was terminated when he took a hard drive off of the employers property, conduct that was clearly against the employers policy.
